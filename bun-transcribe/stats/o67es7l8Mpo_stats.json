  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens with a tense tone, highlighting spiritual threats, past failures like Uzzah's death, and David's personal flaws, evoking caution and struggle. It builds to triumphant victories over enemies through prayer and dependence, then peaks in exuberant joy with music, celebration, and proper worship as the Ark arrives. The arc flows from heavy conflict to light, uplifting praise, ending on a devoted high despite a brief note of criticism.",
