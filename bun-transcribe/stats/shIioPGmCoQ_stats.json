  "sentimentFlow": "The service opens with joyful worship songs and grateful communion, fostering an uplifting and thankful emotional tone. The sermon then turns heavier, highlighting the world's darkness, crookedness, and moral failings to emphasize the need for faithful living. It ends lightly, with hopeful prayers for shining impact and triumphant songs of rescue, freedom, and new beginnings.",
