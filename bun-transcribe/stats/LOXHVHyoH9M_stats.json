  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens on a light, hopeful note celebrating God's patient love and pursuit of his flawed people. It then arcs heavily into dark tales of kings' pride, idolatry, defeats, murders, and brutal consequences, evoking tension and warning. It closes lightly with encouragement to persevere, assured of God's forgiving mercy and ultimate reward.",
