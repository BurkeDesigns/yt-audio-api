  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens with exuberant joy, lively worship songs, and enthusiastic greetings, setting a celebratory tone from the start. It briefly dips into Mary's grief at the empty tomb but swiftly rises to triumphant encouragement through stories of skeptics' conversions, Jesus' power, and personal hope. The emotional arc stays light and uplifting throughout, building steadily to a peak of living hope and eternal promise without any heavy downturn.",
