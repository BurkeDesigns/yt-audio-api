  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon begins with urgent warnings about ticking time, growing lawlessness, rebellion, and terrifying end-times evil led by a deceptive figure, building a heavy tone of fear and impending doom. Midway, it intensifies this darkness with details of deception, tribulation horrors, and unrestrained wickedness. It then arcs toward light, offering hope through ultimate victory, calls to stand firm, God's comforting patience for repentance, and joyful assurance for believers.",
