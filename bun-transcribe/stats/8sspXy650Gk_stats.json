  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens on an upbeat note, celebrating the joy of living in line with God's will, then shifts into practical, encouraging guidance on faithful living—with light-hearted stories, cautions against old habits and division, and motivational calls to love, light, and wisdom. While it briefly acknowledges past darkness and worldly pitfalls for contrast, the tone remains consistently positive and empowering rather than heavy with guilt. It closes triumphantly, circling back to the peace of God's path and a hopeful prayer for strength.",
