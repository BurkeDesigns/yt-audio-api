  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon begins on a heavy note of fear and distress, detailing the massive Assyrian threat, brutal conquests, Hezekiah's mourning, and his near-death illness. It shifts to rising hope through desperate prayers and God's reassuring promises, building to triumphant victory with miracles like the angel's slaughter and supernatural healing. It ends lightly with encouragement, mercy, and a prayer for the audience's healing, emphasizing relief and God's care.",
