  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon starts heavy, rebuking the audience for foolishness and emphasizing the crushing weight of sin, failure, and curse under the law that no one can fully keep. It intensifies this conviction by showing how the law reveals our deep flaws and inability to save ourselves. It then shifts light, celebrating Christ's rescue from the curse, the freedom of faith, and an uplifting invitation to forgiveness and joy.",
