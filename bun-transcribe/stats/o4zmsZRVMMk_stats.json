  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon starts heavy, opening with vivid warnings of Jesus' fierce second coming as a warrior to judge the earth, evoking intensity and urgency about impending justice. It then shifts to a steady, explanatory tone through biblical history and God's reliable promises, blending awe with growing praise. It ends light, celebrating enduring mercy, unconditional love, and salvation, leaving listeners grateful and uplifted.",
