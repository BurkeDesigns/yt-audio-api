  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon starts heavy, confronting hypocrisy, fear, and personal failures like Peter's to challenge listeners on their inconsistent lives. It builds tension through strong calls to self-examination and warnings against shame. It ends light, offering practical steps to overcome fear and a hopeful prayer for boldness, forgiveness, and consistent courage.",
