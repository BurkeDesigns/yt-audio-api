  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon starts on a warm, appreciative note with personal stories honoring fathers, then shifts to a heavier tone highlighting parenting struggles, flawed biblical examples, and kids' rebellious human nature. It builds through practical, hopeful guidance on loving discipline and leadership, ending on an uplifting, encouraging high with assurances of God's help and a prayer blessing all fathers. Overall, the emotional arc moves from light reflection to mid-sermon weight of imperfection, rising to grace-filled empowerment.",
