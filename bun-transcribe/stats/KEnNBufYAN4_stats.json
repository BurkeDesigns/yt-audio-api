  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens heavy, vividly detailing horrific sins like child sacrifice, idolatry, and stubborn rebellion, which lead to brutal consequences such as exile and deadly lions, building a tone of stern warning and divine judgment. This dark mood persists through centuries of ignored pleas for change, emphasizing God's long patience finally giving way to justice. It lightens toward the end with notes of hope in faithful remnants and future restoration, closing on an uplifting call to genuine heart surrender rather than superficial rituals.",
