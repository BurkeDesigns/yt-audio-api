  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon begins with an upbeat, celebratory tone through joyful worship songs focused on victory over death and praise. It shifts to a reflective, grateful mood during communion, remembering sacrifice and forgiveness, before moving into an energetic, triumphant teaching on God's promises, military victories, and encouragement. Overall, it maintains a light, hopeful emotional arc with only a brief cautionary note on temptation at the end, never starting heavy.",
