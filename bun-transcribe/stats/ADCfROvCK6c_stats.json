  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon starts heavy, dwelling on Paul's brutal sufferings, persecutions, and human weaknesses to establish credibility amid doubt. It shifts to a mysterious heavenly vision tempered by humility and pain, building curiosity. It ends light and joyful, painting heaven as a place of beauty, peace, no suffering, and reunions, with a warm call to certain hope and forgiveness.",
