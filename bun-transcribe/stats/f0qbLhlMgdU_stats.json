  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens heavy with grief, outrage, and stark confrontation of evil, violence, hatred, and darkness in the world following Charlie Kirk's assassination. It intensifies this tone by warning of persecution for speaking truth, then arcs toward empowerment through courage, freedom, and bold living. It ends light with inspiration, hope, an invitation to personal faith, and prayer for revival.",
