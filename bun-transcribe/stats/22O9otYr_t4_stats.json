  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens heavy with alarming statistics on teen suicides, drugs, pregnancies, and cultural \"noise\" destroying lives, amplified by the speaker's dark personal past of addiction, parties, and emptiness. It shifts midway to hope through the speaker's transformation, stories of miracles and deliverance, and the empowering \"power from heaven,\" building excitement. It ends light with an uplifting altar call, collective prayer for forgiveness and filling, worship, and baptisms, leaving a tone of revival and joy.",
