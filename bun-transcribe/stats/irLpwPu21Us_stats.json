  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens on a warm, uplifting note with welcoming prayer and calls for refreshment, then shifts to a heavy tone exploring Israel's deep idolatry, ruthless conquests, prejudice, and failed worship that led to captivity and compromise. It introduces some hope through King Hezekiah's bold reforms and trust in God amid Assyrian threats and intimidation, but lingers on fear and surrender before closing lightly with encouragement to stay silent and let God defend, ending in grateful prayer for peace. Overall, the emotional arc waves from light to heavy warnings of consequences, resolving hopefully in reliance on divine protection.",
