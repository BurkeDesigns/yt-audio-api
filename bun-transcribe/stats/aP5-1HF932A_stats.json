  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon begins with a vigilant, cautionary tone about sin's seriousness and triumphs over evil giants, building to a heavy focus on David's prideful sin, temptation, guilt, shame, and devastating consequences like plague and death. It then shifts to relief through David's humble confession and God's merciful restraint, balancing justice with compassion. It ends on a light, hopeful note celebrating forgiveness, intimacy with God, and Jesus' ultimate sacrifice as the final resolution.",
