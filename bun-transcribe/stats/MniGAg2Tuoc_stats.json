  "sentimentFlow": "The Q&A session starts light and cheerful with holiday greetings, gratitude in prayer, and reassuring answers to fears about Satan, prayer, and depression. It maintains an steady, empathetic, and encouraging tone while tackling heavier topics like hell, sin, and forgiveness, always pivoting to hope, God's love, and practical comfort. Rather than a heavy-to-light arc, it remains predominantly uplifting, ending with positive advice on anxiety, relationships, and devotionals before a grateful closing prayer.",
