  "sentimentFlow": "The interview begins heavy, delving deeply into Patty's childhood trauma, self-harm, loneliness, gender confusion, abuse, and unfulfilling same-sex relationships, creating a tone of profound pain and exhaustion. It gradually shifts as she describes her brother's faith sparking curiosity, leading to her conversion alongside her partner, where old desires fade into newfound joy and sisterly friendship. It ends light, filled with hope, freedom, practical advice for loving others, and an uplifting invitation to experience similar transformation.",
