  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon opens with upbeat, joyful worship and welcoming humor, creating a light and celebratory tone. It then dips into a heavier acknowledgment of human brokenness and the weight of wrongdoing from the story of the first garden. The mood swiftly rises to triumphant hope and relief through the redemption in the second garden, culminating in an emotional invitation for change and explosive communal praise.",
