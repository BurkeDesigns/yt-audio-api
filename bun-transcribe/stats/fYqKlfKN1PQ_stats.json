  "sentimentFlow": "The sermon starts on an uplifting note with prayer and communal gratitude, then shifts to a tense and sobering tone as it recounts deception, false prophecies, divine judgment, demonic influence, and King Ahab's grim death. This heavy middle builds a sense of consequence for wickedness, before lightening toward the end with Jehoshaphat's rescue, calls to deeper faithfulness, and a hopeful closing prayer emphasizing God's responsiveness and guidance. Overall, it follows a classic arc from light to heavy warning, ending on an encouraging, relational high.",
