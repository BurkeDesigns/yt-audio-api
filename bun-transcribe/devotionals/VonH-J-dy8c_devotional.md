# 3-Day Devotional: The Gathering Storm

*Object Lesson: Imagine a gathering storm—dark clouds (nations) massing on the horizon, winds (alliances) whipping up, tension building. But the thunderclap? That's God alone.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
### When Clouds Mass Against the Horizon  

I've watched weather apps light up with storm warnings, alliances of thunderheads building miles away, yet powerless to scatter them. News feeds echo this: Russia and Iran deepening ties amid strikes and threats, a coalition brewing. Have you ever sensed the air thicken, knowing a storm looms but unsure when it breaks?  

**Ezekiel 38:2-6 (ESV)**  
"Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him and say, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Gog... Persia, Cush, and Put are with them... Gomer and all his hordes; Beth-togarmah from the uttermost parts of the north..."  

**First Look (Observation):**  
- Which names stand out as leaders or allies in this lineup?  
- Notice the direction "from the uttermost parts of the north"—what weight does that carry?  

**Deepen the Roots:** Ezekiel 38:13; Revelation 16:12.

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
### Why Does God Let the Winds Howl?  

That easy view of distant threats? It crumbles when you see today's headlines mirroring ancient warnings—Russia-Iran treaties, nuclear shadows.  

**Did You Know?** "Magog" traces to Scythian tribes north of the Black Sea, linking to ancient Russia; "Rosh" echoes "chief" or even "Russia" in some linguistics, making this prophecy eerily current.  

**Ezekiel 38:18-19 (ESV)**  
"But on that day... declares the Lord God, my wrath will be up in my anger. For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel."  

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If God delays the thunder until the clouds peak, what does that reveal about His patience with evil?  
- Audit your heart: How does this storm's certainty disrupt your trust in "peaceful" world trends?  

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I am most afraid that if this gathering storm hits as foretold, then ________________.

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
### Ride the Thunder—Look Up  

From spotting storm clouds massing in Ezekiel's vision (Day 1) to wrestling God's delayed thunderclap (Day 2), we see: He brews the storm to reveal His unmatched power, magnifying Himself alone.  

**Luke 21:28 (ESV)**  
"Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."  

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you check news headlines, pause, lift your eyes skyward, and whisper, "This is Your storm, Lord."  

**Breath Prayer:**  
As clouds gather, Father, waken my heart to Your coming thunder—draw me near.  

**The Full Map:**  
Ezekiel 38:2-6, 13, 18-19; Revelation 16:12; Luke 21:28.
