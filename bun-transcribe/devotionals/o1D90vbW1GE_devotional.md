# 3-Day Devotional: The Garden of Your Giving

*Picture your finances as a garden: every dollar a seed, your heart the soil. Stingy hoarding chokes the plot; generous sowing invites harvest. We'll till this ground together over three days—I've clutched my own seeds too tightly before.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**Sowing Stingy or Sowing Surplus?**

Imagine skipping the farmer's market to hoard seeds in your garage, watching them mold while your neighbors feast on fresh veggies. Then picture scattering them wildly, only to see rows burst with abundance. Have you ever gripped your wallet like buried treasure, wondering if release might grow something better?

**Anchor Text:**  
*Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.* (2 Corinthians 9:6-7)

**The "First Look" (Observation):**  
1. Which words paint the sharpest contrast between the two sowers?  
2. Notice the giver's posture—what emotions echo from "heart," "reluctantly," and "cheerful"?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
2 Corinthians 8:7; Proverbs 21:2

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**Grace-Grown, Not Grocery-List Giving**

Did you know wealthy Gentile believers in Corinth—once rivals to suffering Jewish Christians in Jerusalem—were nudged by Paul to complete a long-forgotten pledge amid famine and persecution? This wasn't forced tax; it tested love like soil tests fertility.

**Anchor Text:**  
*...see that you excel in this grace of giving. I am not commanding you...* (2 Corinthians 8:7-8)  
*[*Repeat 2 Corinthians 9:6-7*]*

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation):**  
1. If your giving is a soil sample revealing heart-roots, what weeds (grudge? guilt?) choke your garden now?  
2. Audit this: What lifestyle "crop" would wither if cheerful sowing replaced compulsion?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
Finish this sentence: *I am most afraid that if I sow generously into _____, God might expect me to relinquish _____.*

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Harvest Hands: Sow to Overflow**

From Day 1's seed-contrast to Day 2's heart-weeding, we've seen God's garden thrives not on our grip but His grace—why hold back when abundance awaits the cheerful sower?

**Anchor Text:**  
*And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.* (2 Corinthians 9:8)

**The Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you touch money (spend, save, give), pause, hold it like a seed, and whisper: "Sow this for Your harvest, Lord."

**The Breath Prayer:**  
"Cheerful Sower, till my heart-soil; let me reap Your abundance to give freely. Amen."

**The Full Map:**  
2 Corinthians 8:7-8; 9:6-8; Proverbs 21:2
