# A Glove Without a Hand

## Day 1: The Encounter (Dead or Alive?)
**The Hook:** Limp and Useless—Until the Hand Slips In.

**The Narrative Bridge:** Picture a glove lying flat on the table, perfectly shaped but utterly powerless—unable to grip, wave, or work. It mimics life: looks fine on the outside but can't move without something inside. Have you ever felt that way, busy yet empty, chasing desires that leave you unchanged?

**The Anchor Text:**  
*Ephesians 2:1-10 (NIV)*  
As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the desires of the flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

**The "First Look" (Observation):**  
- Notice the shift from verses 1-3 to 4-10—what three "forces" keep us "dead," and what three make us "alive"?  
- Which word in verse 10 echoes the glove's sudden purpose when the hand fills it?

**Deepen the Roots:** Romans 12:2; Galatians 5:16-21.

## Day 2: The Wrestle (Resisting the Fit?)
**The Challenge:** Grace Isn't Fair—It Fits a Glove That Fought Back.

**The Cultural Lens:** "Did you know?" In Ephesus, a hub of sorcery and emperor worship, Paul wrote from prison to believers squeezed by "the ruler of the air"—a nod to pervasive pagan spirits broadcast like invisible radio waves, blinding people to their spiritual death.

**The Anchor Text:** Ephesians 2:1-10 (repeated for the wrestle); Mirror Passage: Romans 5:8—But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation):**  
- If you're that glove—dead, molded by world, devil, and flesh—what part of your life still resists the Hand's grip?  
- Audit verse 8-9: If salvation is God's gift, not your effort, what "works" are you clutching that make grace hard to swallow?

**The Journaling Prompt:** I am most afraid that if I let the Hand (Holy Spirit) fill me completely, then...

## Day 3: The Transformation (Grip Your Purpose)
**The Invitation:** Let the Hand Take Over—Work Awaits.

**The Synthesis:** We've peered at the glove's limp state under world, devil, and flesh, then wrestled its resistance to mercy, love, and grace. Now, filled by Christ, you're crafted for works God prepped just for you.

**The Anchor Text:** Ephesians 2:10—For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

**The Living Discovery (Application):** For the next 24 hours, pick up a real glove (or imagine one). Every time you use your hands—for eating, typing, or holding something—pause, flex your fingers, and whisper, "Hand, fill this glove for Your work today."

**The Breath Prayer:** Holy Spirit, slip into my limp places; make me alive for the good works You've prepared. Amen.

**The Full Map:**  
Ephesians 2:1-10; Romans 12:2; Galatians 5:16-21; Romans 5:8.
