# A Postcard from Paradise  
*Three days peering at heaven's glimpse through Paul's reluctant words—a postcard too vivid to ignore, too holy to hoard.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**The Glimpse That Stuns**  

I've held faded postcards from distant shores, their colors faded but promises sharp—reminding me of homes I've never seen. Paul's words feel like that: a reluctant sketch of paradise amid his bruises and shipwrecks. Have you ever clutched a memory too immense to share without sounding mad?  

**Anchor Text**  
*I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows. And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows—was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.* (2 Corinthians 12:1-6, NIV)  

**First Look (Observation)**  
- What repeated phrase shows Paul's inner tug-of-war?  
- Notice the "third heaven"—which details make it feel layers beyond our sky?  

**Deepen the Roots**  
- Isaiah 55:9 (heaven's thoughts towering over ours).  
- Revelation 4:1-2 (a door standing open in heaven).

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Paradise's Postcard Comes with Thorns**  

That postcard from paradise? It arrived ink-smudged, edges torn—hinting at a cost behind the glory.  

**Did You Know?**  
In Jewish thought, the "third heaven" meant God's throne room itself—beyond sky and stars—not a vague afterlife, but a realm where words fail and pride shatters (hence Paul's unnamed "thorn," v. 7).  

**Anchor Text**  
*Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.* (2 Corinthians 12:7-8, NIV)  

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation)**  
- If paradise's glimpse humbled Paul to silence, what "boast" in your life does this postcard audit?  
- Imagine clutching inexpressible truth—why might God seal some words, and what defenses rise in you?  

**Journaling Prompt**  
I am most afraid that if I relinquish my thorns to pursue paradise, then...

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Step Toward the Sender**  

From Day 1's stunned peek at the postcard to Day 2's thorn-pricked wrestle, Paul's vision reveals heaven not as escape, but God's pull through our fractures—why we boast in weakness, how eternity invades now.  

**Anchor Text**  
*Eye has not seen, ear has not heard... what God has prepared for those who love him.* (1 Corinthians 2:9, NIV)  

**Living Discovery (Application)**  
For the next 24 hours, every time pain or weakness flares (a thorn moment), whisper aloud: "This postcard points to paradise," then name one frailty you're offering up.  

**Breath Prayer**  
God of the third heaven, unseal my heart to love You more; draw me home through every crack.
