# The Borrowed Altar: A 3-Day Devotional

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**The Hook:** *When Fear Copies an Enemy's Altar*

Imagine spotting a flashy neighbor's setup that promises security amid chaos—you sketch it, build a copy in your own living room, and start dismantling your family's cherished spaces to make it fit. Your home shifts from sanctuary to stranger's outpost, all to dodge the storm outside. Have you ever borrowed a "fix" from the world that quietly invaded your core?

**Anchor Text:**  
*2 Kings 16:10-11*  
"Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. He saw an altar in Damascus and sent to Uriah the priest a sketch of the altar, with detailed plans for its construction. So Uriah the priest built an altar in accordance with all the plans sent by King Ahaz from Damascus and finished it before Ahaz returned." (NIV)

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What details stand out about how the new altar enters God's temple?  
- Notice the roles—who builds, who orders, and what gets sidelined?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Isaiah 7:14; Amos 4:2-3

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**The Challenge:** *Compromise Doesn't Save—It Surrenders*

**Cultural Lens:** In the ancient Near East, altars declared unbreakable allegiance; Ahaz's "borrowed altar" wasn't decoration—it swapped God's kingship for Assyria's boot, inviting exile as vassalage (2 Kings 17 details 725 years of such drift ending in lions and deportation).

**Anchor Text:**  
*2 Kings 16:10-11* (repeated) + *Mirror Passage:* 2 Kings 17:7-8  
"All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt... They worshiped other gods and followed the practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before them." (NIV)

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If a borrowed altar signals fear over faith, what "foreign sketches" defend your daily grip?  
- Audit this: What temple space (time, priorities) have you dismantled to fit the world's design?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
"I notice my own borrowed altar most when ________, and it scares me because ________."

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**The Invitation:** *Dismantle the Altar—Reclaim Your King's House*

From sketching a stranger's altar in Day 1 to tracing centuries of compromise in Day 2, we see fear's blueprint: it never fortifies but always forfeits ground to the enemy. Now relinquish it—true security dawns in surrendered allegiance to the promised King.

**Anchor Text (Sending):**  
*Isaiah 7:14*  
"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." (NIV)

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time your phone buzzes with a distraction, pause, name it a "borrowed altar sketch," and pray: "Lord, this isn't Yours—dismantle it."

**Breath Prayer:**  
Inhale: "You alone are King." Exhale: "I relinquish the borrowed altar."
