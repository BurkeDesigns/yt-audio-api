# Faith in the Mirror: A 3-Day Devotional

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**The Mirror's Unsparing Gaze**

I've stood before mirrors that didn't flinch—smudged mascara after a cry, spinach in my teeth mid-smile, exhaustion etched in every line. That reflection demands attention but hands you nothing to fix it. Have you ever stared into a truth that laid bare your mess without a single solution?

**Anchor Text** (Galatians 3:10-11, NKJV):  
*For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.” But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.”*

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What single word in verse 10 repeats to hammer home the problem?  
- Notice the shift from "curse" to "faith"—what tone does it carry?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Genesis 15:6 (NKJV): *And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.*  
James 2:10 (NKJV): *For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.*

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**When the Mirror Cracks Your Pride**

That mirror from Day 1? In Paul's world, it was the law—a strict tutor (paidagogos), like a household slave escorting a child to school, rigid and unrelenting. "Did you know?" Judaizers demanded circumcision and feasts on top of Jesus, turning grace into a checklist. This isn't easy; it stings because we love our lists.

**Anchor Text** (Galatians 3:24, NKJV):  
*Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.*

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If the mirror (law) only exposes without cleansing, what "perfect performance" in your life feels cursed right now?  
- Audit your heart: What effort are you still betting on to prove you're "good enough"?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
Finish this: *I'm most afraid that if I trust faith alone in ________, then ________.*

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**Shatter the Mirror, Step into Grace**

From Day 1's raw exposure to Day 2's soul-wrenching wrestle, the mirror has done its job: revealing our desperate need. Now, Christ shatters its verdict, redeeming us so faith unlocks Abraham's blessing—righteousness for all who believe.

**Anchor Text** (Galatians 3:13-14, NKJV):  
*Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”); that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.*

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you glance in a mirror, pause, touch your reflection, and whisper, "Jesus, you cleansed what this can't."

**Breath Prayer:**  
Jesus, you became my curse on the tree—wash me by faith alone.

**The Full Map:**  
Galatians 3:10-11, 13-14, 24; Genesis 15:6; James 2:10.
