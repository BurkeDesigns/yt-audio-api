# Sunrise in the Garden: A 3-Day Resurrection Devotional

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**The Dawn's Empty Promise**

Imagine slipping into your backyard at first light, where your most treasured plant lay buried through winter—only to find the soil disturbed, the spot bare. You summon friends; they peer in, marvel at the wrappings left behind, then walk away shaking their heads. Have you ever lingered alone in that dim glow, tears blurring what might be stirring right before you?

**Anchor Text:**  
*John 20:14-16 (NIV)*  
At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What details about Mary's posture and perception stand out in the half-light?  
- Which single word from Jesus pierces the dawn silence?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Proverbs 27:14; 1 Peter 1:3-4

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**The Light That Stings the Eyes**

Like squinting at sunrise after a night of grief, the facts glare: an empty garden plot where death should hold court.  

**Cultural Lens:** Did you know? In first-century Judea, a woman's courtroom testimony held no weight—yet Mary becomes the first herald of the risen Lord, flipping expectations upside down.

**Anchor Text:**  
*John 20:14-16 (repeated); Mirror Passage: 1 Peter 1:3-4 (NIV)*  
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade.

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If this gardener *is* the tomb's occupant alive and speaking your name, what preconception in your life does it uproot?  
- Why might the dawn's light demand we audit our doubts before embracing its warmth?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I am most afraid that if I let this resurrection dawn chase away my shadows over ________, then ________.

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**Step Into the Full Sun**

**The Gardener Calls Your Name**  

From dawn's foggy glimpse of an empty garden to wrestling its blinding truth, we've traded observer's tears for the sun's unrelenting call: Resurrection isn't just historical heat—it's personal fire, proving Jesus alive to rename and reclaim us. Now, live it: the light that startled Mary summons you.  

**Anchor Text (Sending):**  
*Revelation 2:17 (NIV)*  
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time sunlight hits your face—pause, whisper "Mary," and listen silently for two breaths, as if the Gardener speaks your new name.

**Breath Prayer:**  
*Risen Gardener, call me by name into Your dawn-light life; Amen.*

**The Full Map:**  
Proverbs 27:14; John 20:14-16; 1 Peter 1:3-4; Revelation 2:17.
