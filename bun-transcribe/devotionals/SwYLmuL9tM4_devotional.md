# A Father's Finish Line: Joy in the Race God Runs with Us

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**When Your Hamstring Snaps Mid-Race**

Imagine the 1992 Barcelona Olympics: Derek Redmond surges ahead in the 400m, then crumples, hamstring torn, pain etching his face as the crowd gasps. His father Jim vaults barriers, wraps an arm around him, and they hobble to the finish amid thunderous cheers. Have you ever hit a wall in your own race—dream shattered, body failing—wondering if anyone sees?

**Philippians 1:3-6 (ESV)**  
*I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.*

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What repeated word pulses through Paul's prison prayer like a heartbeat?  
- Notice the timeline Paul traces—who starts the work, and when does it end?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Psalm 138:8; John 14:16-18

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Your Legs Give Out—But His Grip Doesn't**

**Did you know?** Paul wrote from a Roman prison cell around 62 AD to Philippi—a gritty Roman colony with no synagogue, mostly Gentiles he'd won to Christ during his own "limping" second missionary journey.

**Philippians 1:3-6; 2:12-13 (ESV)**  
*[Repeat 1:3-6]* ...*so now that we have confidence in the Lord, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.*

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If God began *your* good work, what half-finished project in your life resists His steady hand?  
- Audit this: What does "work out" demand from you while God "works in"—and why the tension?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I resist letting God finish His work in me because...

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Hobbling Home—Arm in Arm to "Well Done"**

We've glimpsed Paul's joyful confidence in a God who starts strong (Day 1), then wrestled the gritty partnership He demands amid our faltering steps (Day 2). Now imagine crossing *that* finish line—not disqualified, but embraced by the Father who runs beside you.

**Philippians 2:13 (ESV)**  
*for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.*

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time pain or delay hits (like checking a stalled email), pause, grip your wrist as if held, and whisper, "He who began will complete."

**Breath Prayer:**  
Father, grip my hobble—finish Your joy in me.
