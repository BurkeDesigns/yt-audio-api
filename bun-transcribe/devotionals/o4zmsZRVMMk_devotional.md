# The House God Builds

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**Your Palace, His Tent**

Imagine settling into your dream home after years of renting cramped apartments. You spot your landlord's old toolbox still in a leaky shed out back, so you grab hammer and nails to build him something better. But what if he shows up with blueprints for *your* forever mansion? Have you ever offered God your best plan, only to wonder if He's sketching something wildly different?

**Anchor Text:**  
*1 Chronicles 17:1-4 (NIV)*  
After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under a tent."  
Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you."  
But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the Lord says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.'"

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What sharp contrast grabs your attention between David's "house" and God's "tent"?  
- Which phrase in God's message flips David's assumption on its head?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Psalm 127:1; Genesis 12:1-3

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Who Holds the Hammer?**

**Anchor Text:**  
*1 Chronicles 17:7-10, 12 (NIV)*  
"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the Lord Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. ... I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth. ... He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.'"

**Cultural Lens:**  
"Did you know?" In ancient kings' playbooks, building a temple cemented their legacy—David's cedar palace screamed success, yet God, who dwelled in a portable tent through wilderness wanderings, rejected that script.

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If God builds *your* house instead of you building His, what "cedar comforts" in your life feel exposed as shaky foundations?  
- Notice God's shepherd-to-king journey with David—what does that stir in you about who truly authors your story?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I am most afraid that if I relinquish my blueprint for ________, then God might build something ________.

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Step Into Your Forever House**

From eyeing the mismatched palace and tent (Day 1) to wrestling God's shepherd-strong refusal to let David swing the hammer (Day 2), we see the Builder's blueprint: human efforts topple, but God's promises endure like an unshakeable dynasty.

**Anchor Text (Sending Verse):**  
*Luke 1:32-33 (NIV)*  
"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you walk through a door (home, car, office), pause, touch the frame, and whisper, "God, build this house—Yours, not mine."

**Breath Prayer:**  
Inhale: "You took me from the pasture..." Exhale: "...to build my forever house."

**The Full Map:**  
1 Chronicles 17:1-4, 7-10, 12; Psalm 127:1; Genesis 12:1-3; Luke 1:32-33
