# Shatter the Snake: A 3-Day Devotional on Idols in Disguise

*Object Lesson: Imagine the bronze serpent—God's gift for healing in Numbers 21, lifted high so the dying could look and live. Yet centuries later, it became Nehushtan, a shiny idol people burned incense to. What starts as rescue can slither into chains. We'll track this snake across three days.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**The Snake You Worship**

I clutched a faded medal from my dad's war days, a reminder of survival that turned into my excuse for bitterness. Good memorials morph into grudges we polish daily. Have you ever treasured a "rescue story" from God that now bites back?

**Anchor Text**  
*2 Kings 18:3-4 (NIV)*  
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father David had done. He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan.)

**The "First Look" (Observation)**  
- What bold action does Hezekiah take toward objects of worship?  
- Notice the parenthetical detail: What name do they give the bronze serpent, and what does that reveal about its hold?

**Deepen the Roots**  
- Numbers 21:8-9 (the serpent's origin as healing symbol)  
- John 4:19-24 (worship in spirit and truth)

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**Fear the Lions, Keep the Idols?**

**Did you know?** Assyria crushed northern Israel around 723 BC, deporting tribes and importing pagans. God sent lions as judgment on their half-hearted faith; a priest returned, but they feared God superficially—like dodging trouble while clutching old sins. Samaritans were born from this mix: Jews called them "half-breeds," fueling prejudice (see John 4's well encounter).

**Anchor Text** (Mirror Passage)  
*2 Kings 17:34-35, 41 (NIV)*  
To this day they persist in their former practices... They worshiped the Lord, but they also served their own gods... Even while these people were worshiping the Lord, they were serving their idols.

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation)**  
- Audit your heart: What "Nehushtan"—a past God-rescue—do you now worship instead of Him?  
- If lions prowled today for divided loyalty, which idol would you hide first?

**The Journaling Prompt**  
Finish this: "I fear that if I shatter my Nehushtan of ________, God might ask me to live without ________."

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Trust Like Hezekiah—Smash and Stand**

From eyeing Hezekiah's hammer on Day 1 to sifting our snake-like idols on Day 2, we see the why: God demands whole hearts, not polished compromises, so we trade chains for courage.

**Anchor Text** (Sending Verse)  
*2 Kings 18:5 (NIV)*  
Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him.

**The Living Discovery (Application)**  
For the next 24 hours, name one Nehushtan (like your phone as "security idol"). Every time you reach for it, pause, lay it down for 10 seconds, and declare aloud, "This is not my God."

**The Breath Prayer**  
"Lord, shatter my Nehushtans; teach me to trust You alone, as Hezekiah did."
