# 3-Day Devotional: Gathering Around the Family Table of God's Faithfulness

*We're all pulling up chairs to this table, flipping through stories of God's work—not to pat our own backs, but to marvel at Him. Join me as a fellow guest, hungry for what He serves up.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**Who Steals the Show at God's Table?**

Picture a lively family table after Thanksgiving: aunts and uncles swap tales of storms weathered and surprise provisions, not to brag, but to point to the Cook behind it all. Eyes widen as the stories build, turning heads toward the real hero. Have you ever sat at such a gathering where the highlights weren't about the sharers, but echoed something far bigger?

**Anchor Text:**  
*Exodus 15:11*  
“Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?  
Who is like you, majestic in holiness,  
awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?”

**The "First Look" (Observation):**  
1. Notice the repeated question—what tone does it set for the whole verse?  
2. Which of the four descriptions—majestic, holiness, awesome, wonders—feels heaviest here, and why?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Psalm 100:1-3; Psalm 100:4-5

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**Why Do Our Stories Often Sideline the Star?**

**Did you know?** Exodus 15:11 comes from Moses' victory song right after the Red Sea parted—a public anthem sung to a grumbling, freshly rescued Israel, forcing them to face God's power amid their doubts and fresh slavery scars.

**Anchor Text:**  
*Exodus 15:11* (repeated)  
“Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?  
Who is like you, majestic in holiness,  
awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?”  

*Mirror Passage:* Psalm 100:4-5  
“Enter his gates with thanksgiving... For the Lord is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.”

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation):**  
1. If God's deeds alone deserve the awe, what in your life do you credit to your own effort instead?  
2. Audit this: How does spotlighting Him challenge your instinct to stay quiet about serving?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I resist passing the mic to God at the table because...

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Pull Up Your Chair—Share a Slice of His Story**

From eavesdropping on God's glorious deeds at the family table (Day 1), we've wrestled the hard truth that our tales must echo Him, not us (Day 2). Now, taste the feast by adding your voice to the chorus of faithfulness.

**Anchor Text:**  
*Psalm 100:1*  
“Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!”

**The Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you sit for a meal or snack, pause one minute: Name aloud one specific "glorious deed" of God you've spotted lately—like a volunteer step or answered outreach prayer—and thank Him by name.

**The Breath Prayer:**  
Majestic Lord, tune my voice to Your wonders—let me shout Your deeds today.

**The Full Map:**  
- Exodus 15:11  
- Psalm 100:1-3  
- Psalm 100:4-5  
- Psalm 100:1
