# The Cracked Foundation: A 3-Day Devotional

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**Building on Shaky Ground**

I've watched friends pour sweat into homes, slapping paint over foundation cracks, convinced it's "close enough." Seasons pass, and the whole structure groans under ignored flaws. Have you ever settled for a "good enough" spiritual base, sensing the hidden wobble?

**The Anchor Text**  
*2 Kings 15:3-5 (NKJV)*  
"And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah had done, *except that the high places were not removed*; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. Then the Lord struck the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death; and he dwelt in an isolated house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land."

**The "First Look" (Observation)**  
1. Which word flags the tiny "except" that splinters the king's good start?  
2. What does the king's isolation reveal about unchecked cracks?

**Deepen the Roots**  
2 Kings 14:3-4; 2 Chronicles 26:16-21.

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**Cracks No King Could Hide**

**Did you know?** High places were pagan hilltop shrines—tolerating them mixed idol worship with God's altar, a direct defiance of commands to destroy them (Deuteronomy 12:2-4). These kings knew better but let leaks persist.

**The Anchor Text**  
*2 Chronicles 26:16 (NKJV)*—a mirror crack:  
"But when he was strong his heart was *lifted up, to his destruction*, for he transgressed against the Lord his God by entering the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense."

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation)**  
1. If pride crumbled a "righteous" king, what high place in your routine defends your comfort?  
2. This text tastes bitter—how does it audit the isolation pride carves in *your* life?

**The Journaling Prompt**  
Finish this sentence: "The crack in my foundation I ignore is ________, and I'm afraid that if God exposes it, ________."

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Rebuild Before the Collapse**

We've noticed cracks in partial obedience like Uzziah's, wrestled pride's lonely fallout—yet God's patient heart chases restoration, not ruin (2 Peter 3:9). Sow humbly now; He rebuilds what we crack.

**The Anchor Text**  
*Galatians 6:7-8 (NKJV)*  
"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life."

**The Living Discovery (Application)**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you catch a prideful thought (boasting inwardly or dismissing others), freeze, name the crack aloud—"Pride here"—and relinquish it: "Lord, shore this up."

**The Breath Prayer**  
"God, expose my cracks; build me unshakeable on Christ."
