# Unity in the Mosaic: A 3-Day Devotional

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**Differences That Don't Divide**  

Imagine a mosaic where every tile—jagged red, smooth blue, tiny speckled—refuses to fit, clashing in a pile of chaos. Yet when pieced together by a master's hand, they reveal a breathtaking portrait. We've all chased uniformity to avoid friction, flattening our edges to blend in. Have you ever hidden your unique shape, fearing it would shatter the picture?  

**Anchor Text:**  
*Galatians 3:26-29 (ESV)*  
*for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.*  

**First Look (Observation):**  
- Notice the list of divisions Paul names—what repeats about them?  
- Which phrase hints at how these differences shift in Christ?  

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Colossians 3:11; Revelation 5:9.

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**Equality That Keeps You Distinct**  

Picture your mosaic tile: Does fitting into the whole mean losing your color or cut? No—the beauty demands your uniqueness.  

**Did you know?** In Paul's day, some Jewish men prayed daily, thanking God they weren't born Gentile, slave, or woman—revealing deep prejudices even faith communities nursed.  

**Anchor Text:**  
*Galatians 3:28 (ESV)*  
*There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.*  
*(Mirror Passage: Acts 10:34-35)*  

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If differences don't vanish in Christ, what tension does that create in how you view your roles or others'?  
- Audit your prejudices: Where do you rank people by background, silently esteeming some "lesser"?  

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I resist this unity most when I fear that embracing ______'s differences means _______.

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**Fit Your Tile into His Masterpiece**  

From Day 1's curious glance at divisions dissolving in Christ, to Day 2's wrestle with preserved distinctions, we see God's mosaic thrives on variety held in faith's glue—uniting us as heirs without erasing who we are.  

**Anchor Text:**  
*John 13:35 (ESV)*  
*By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.*  

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you notice a difference in someone (accent, status, role), pause, name it silently, then whisper, "One in Christ," and smile genuinely.  

**Breath Prayer:**  
Jesus, shape my tile into Your mosaic; help me love across every divide.  

**The Full Map:**  
Galatians 3:26-29; Colossians 3:11; Revelation 5:9; Acts 10:34-35; John 13:35.
