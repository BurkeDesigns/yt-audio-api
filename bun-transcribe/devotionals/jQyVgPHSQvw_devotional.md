# 3-Day Devotional: Christ at Home in Your Heart-House

*Imagine your heart as a house. Over these three days, we'll peer through its windows (Day 1), wrestle with the clutter inside (Day 2), and fling open the doors for the ultimate Resident (Day 3). This metaphor anchors Paul's prison prayer in Ephesians 3—raw, kneeling, and aimed at depths we can't reach alone.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**Glancing at the Door of Your Heart-House**

I've returned from long trips to find my house dusty and disorganized, longing for it to feel welcoming again. A true friend wouldn't judge the mess; they'd help unpack and settle in. But what if the Guest transforms the whole place? Have you ever paused at your own front door, wondering who's really welcome inside?

**Anchor Text (Ephesians 3:14-17, NKJV):**  
*For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith...*

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What action does Paul take first, and how does it set the tone for his requests?  
- Notice the progression: from "strengthened...in the inner man" to "Christ may dwell." Which word hints at permanence, like settling into a house?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
- Daniel 6:10 (NKJV): Daniel's kneeling habit amid threats.  
- Ephesians 1:15-19 (NKJV): Paul's first prayer for eyes to see deeper.

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Clutter Blocking Christ from Your Heart-House**

Did you know Paul penned this from a Roman prison under Nero's terror—chained, yet kneeling to pray for *others'* inner strength? His words disrupt our tidy faith: true dwelling demands we audit the "inner man," that hidden house we guard fiercely.

**Anchor Text (Ephesians 3:17-19, NKJV):**  
*...that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and the length and the depth and the height—to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.*

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- These dimensions of love surround your heart-house like walls—width, length, depth, height. What room in your life resists being measured by such vastness?  
- "Passes knowledge" means experiential, not just head-stuff. If Christ's love floods every corner, what hidden mess does it expose that you've defended?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
Finish this sentence: *I'm most afraid that if Christ dwells fully in my heart-house, He'll rearrange...*

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Fling Open Your Heart-House to the Fullness**

We've glimpsed the door (Day 1), sifted the clutter (Day 2). Now, Paul's vision: a heart-house not half-empty, but brimming—because the Resident's power exceeds our wildest remodel.

**Anchor Text (Ephesians 3:20-21, NKJV):**  
*Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.*

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you walk through a doorway in your actual house, pause, touch the frame, and whisper: "Christ, strengthen my inner man here through Your Spirit."

**Breath Prayer:**  
*Inhale:* Father, root me in Your vast love. *Exhale:* Fill my heart-house with Your fullness.
