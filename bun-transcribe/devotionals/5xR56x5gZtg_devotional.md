# 3-Day Devotional: Squeezed Play-Doh to Radiant Pottery

*Object Lesson:* Picture your life as Play-Doh. The world grabs it, squeezes it with external pressures, forcing it into temporary, silly shapes—conformity. But God's Kingdom power is like a potter's kiln and wheel: it fires and reshapes from within, turning soft dough into enduring, glowing pottery that reflects His glory. We'll track this across three days.

## Day 1: The Encounter (The Hook & The Book)

### The Glow Beneath the Squeeze
I've watched kids mash Play-Doh into lopsided blobs, laughing at the chaos, while the lump just takes the abuse. That's our world—pressing us into shapes that fade fast, hiding our true design. Have you ever felt squeezed flat, wondering if there's more beneath the surface?

**Anchor Text:**  
*Mark 9:2-3*  
After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone could bleach them.

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What surprises you most about Jesus' sudden change—His appearance, clothes, or companions?  
- Which word paints the heaviest picture of power here: "transfigured," "dazzling," or "whiter"?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
- Romans 12:2  
- 2 Peter 1:16-18

## Day 2: The Wrestle (The Look & The Tension)

### When God's Squeeze Feels Uncomfortable
Sure, Jesus glowed—but notice the disciples' terror amid the cloud? The easy take is "cool miracle," but this disrupts: God's Kingdom doesn't pat Play-Doh gently; it spins and heats it, cracking old forms.

**Did You Know?** "Transfigured" (Greek *metamorphoō*) means a total inside-out change—like a caterpillar liquifying in its chrysalis to emerge transformed. No shortcuts.

**Anchor Text (Mirror Passage):**  
*Romans 12:2*  
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If the world's squeeze molds you externally, what internal "Play-Doh lump" in your thinking resists God's wheel?  
- Audit your week: Where has conformity dimmed your glow, and what fear bubbles up if God reshapes it?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I sense God squeezing my Play-Doh life most in ________, because if He transforms it, then ________.

**Deepen the Roots:**  
- Hebrews 4:12  

## Day 3: The Transformation (The Took & The Life)

### Fired Pottery: Live the Glow
From Day 1's shocking shine to Day 2's uncomfortable spin, we've seen God's Kingdom isn't future fireworks—it's present power, firing Play-Doh into unbreakable pottery via His Word and Spirit. Why? So we reflect Christ's radiance now, altering homes, work, everything.

**Anchor Text (Sending):**  
*2 Corinthians 3:18*  
And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time your phone buzzes (world's squeeze), pause, whisper "Renew my mind," and read one Bible verse aloud—watch the inner glow build.

**Breath Prayer:**  
As You wheel my Play-Doh life, Lord, fire me into Your radiant image today.
