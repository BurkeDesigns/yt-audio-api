# Watchmen on the Wall: A 3-Day Discovery

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**The Trumpet at Your Lips**

Imagine scanning the horizon from an ancient city wall, heart pounding as dust clouds signal invaders below. Your trumpet dangles like a stone around your neck—one blast could save the city or shatter the peace. Have you ever gripped a truth so urgent it burned your throat, yet feared the echo?

**Anchor Text**  
*Ezekiel 33:7-9 (NIV)*  
"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them about their sin or tell them to repent of their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, but you will have saved yourself."

**The "First Look" (Observation)**  
- What repeated action does the watchman take, and how does God tie it directly to life or death?  
- Notice the shift from "I have made you" to "you will have saved yourself"—which word punches hardest here?

**Deepen the Roots**  
- Ezekiel 33:1-6 (the trumpet's blast)  
- 2 Kings 9:17-20 (a real watchtower in action)

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**When Mercy Clashes with the Call**

Did you know? Ancient watchmen perched on towers or gates—not glamorous posts, but gritty outposts where one ignored signal meant slaughter for hundreds (like Habakkuk 2:1 echoes).

**Anchor Text** (Mirror Passage)  
*Ezekiel 33:11 (NIV)*  
"Say to them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?’"

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation)**  
- If God's trumpet pleads for turning rather than destruction, what part of your life resists that urgent "Turn!"?  
- Audit this: The watchman warns, but God yearns—what does that tension reveal about whose hands hold the real blood?

**The Journaling Prompt**  
I am most afraid that if I sound the watchman's trumpet in ________, then ________.

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Climb the Wall—Your Shift Begins**

From peering at the watchman's lonely post (Day 1) to wrestling God's aching plea for turners (Day 2), we see: Obedience frees you from outcomes, because the Sovereign One craves life over death—now step up.

**Anchor Text** (Sending Verse)  
*Matthew 5:16 (NIV)*  
"In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

**The Living Discovery (Application)**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you pass through a door (home, office, car), pause like a watchman at the gate, scan your surroundings, and whisper one bold truth aloud to God about someone nearby.

**The Breath Prayer**  
"God, post me on Your wall—give me eyes to see threats and lips for Your trumpet of life."
