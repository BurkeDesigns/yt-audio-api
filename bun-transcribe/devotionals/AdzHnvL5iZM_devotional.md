# Cornerstone of the Heart: A 3-Day Devotional

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**The Stone That Promises But Cracks**

Imagine stacking your life’s bricks on a smooth stone you found in the rubble of childhood hurts—rejection’s cold weight feels secure at first. But storms hit, and fissures spiderweb through, leaving you scrambling for cover, just like Patty chasing love in shadows of abuse and confusion. Have you ever built your worth on a cornerstone that now threatens to topple everything?

**Anchor Text**  
*“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame. Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.’”* (1 Peter 2:6-7)

**The "First Look" (Observation)**  
1. Which words describe the true cornerstone’s origin and value?  
2. Who interacts with this stone, and what’s the sharp contrast in their responses?

**Deepen the Roots**  
- Psalm 118:22  
- Isaiah 28:16  

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**When Your Cornerstone Demands Demolition**

**Did you know?** In ancient construction, builders often rejected the master cornerstone if it didn’t “fit” their plans—dooming the whole structure—echoing Psalm 118’s prophecy fulfilled in Jesus, the stone human agendas discard.

**Anchor Text** (Mirror Passage)  
*“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone...”* (1 Peter 2:6)  
*“[You are] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.”* (Ephesians 2:20)

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation)**  
1. If rejection has been your hidden cornerstone, what daily "bricks" in your habits or relationships does it fail to support?  
2. Audit your soul: What fears arise if the rejected Stone becomes your foundation instead?

**The Journaling Prompt**  
Finish this sentence: *“I cling to this counterfeit cornerstone because if I relinquish it, then...”*

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Anchor Your Life to the Unshakable Stone**

From Day 1’s cracks in our self-made stones to Day 2’s gritty teardown of rejection’s lies, Christ reveals Himself as the why—chosen, precious, eternal—inviting us to rebuild without shame. Now step into the how: lives transformed, attractions reordered, confusion conquered.

**Anchor Text** (Sending Verse)  
*I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.* (1 Corinthians 15:31, NASB)

**The Living Discovery (Application)**  
For the next 24 hours, every time rejection stings (a memory, glance, or doubt), press your hand to your chest, name it as a counterfeit stone, and declare aloud, “Christ, You are my cornerstone.”

**The Breath Prayer**  
*Inhale:* Jesus, chosen cornerstone; *Exhale:* I demolish the fake and trust You.
