# 3-Day Devotional: The Lantern of Truth

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**Enemies for Holding the Lantern?**

Imagine hiking a dark trail at night, your lantern flickering to life, revealing jagged rocks ahead that could trip you. Suddenly, fellow hikers curse the light—it exposes their wrong path—and turn on you, the bearer. Have you ever shared a hard fact that flipped friends into foes?  

**Anchor Text:**  
*Galatians 4:16 (ESV)*  
"Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?"  

**First Look (Observation):**  
- What single word in this question reveals Paul's raw vulnerability?  
- Notice the shift from friendship to enmity—what sparks it?  

**Deepen the Roots:**  
- John 15:18-19  
- Matthew 5:11-12  

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**What If Your Lantern Exposes *You*?**

**Did you know?** In Paul's day, "truth" (aletheia in Greek) meant unveiled reality—like ripping off a veil—often sparking rage because it shattered comfortable illusions, just as Pilate dodged Jesus' claim in John 18:37-38.  

**Anchor Text (Mirror Passage):**  
*John 3:19-21 (ESV)*  
"And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."  

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If this lantern's beam hates hiding evil, what in your life recoils from its glare?  
- Audit your closest relationships: where does silence protect peace over truth?  

**Journaling Prompt:**  
"I resist the lantern's light most when it shines on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because then I'd have to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."  

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**Carry the Lantern into the Shadows**

From Day 1's startling encounter to Day 2's painful self-exposure, the lantern doesn't just illuminate paths—it demands we walk them, trading enmity for eternal gain as truth sets us free (John 8:32,36).  

**Anchor Text (Sending):**  
*Philippians 1:20-21 (ESV)*  
"...Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."  

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time your phone buzzes with news or a debate, pause, hold up the lantern silently: whisper, "Truth over comfort," and type or speak one bold fact.  

**Breath Prayer:**  
*Lantern of truth, expose my shadows and steady my hand to carry you.*
