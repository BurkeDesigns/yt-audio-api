# 3-Day Devotional: Coaching from the Father's Playbook

*We're all in the game of life, fumbling through like rookie dads or flawed players. Using the "coach's playbook" metaphor—strict plays, tough drills, victory huddles—we'll discover how Ephesians 6:4 turns fathers into Heavenly Coaches, training kids without benching their spirits.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**The Coach Who Doesn't Crush the Rookie**

Imagine a football coach spotting raw talent in a scrawny kid—yelling plays, running drills, but never breaking the drive with endless rage. He pushes because he sees potential, not perfection. Have you ever watched a coach light a fire in a player without burning them out?

**Anchor Text**  
*Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.* (Ephesians 6:4, ESV)

**First Look (Observation)**  
- What two actions does this verse command—one to *avoid*, one to *embrace*?  
- Notice the phrase "discipline and instruction"—which word feels like a game plan, and why?

**Deepen the Roots**  
- Deuteronomy 6:6-7  
- Hebrews 12:11  

*(Reflect quietly. What grabs you first?)*

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**When Your Playbook Backfires**

Even star coaches fumble—think biblical dads like Eli, whose "scoundrel" sons ran wild under lax calls, or David, whose 70 sons sparked rebellion and tragedy. No human playbook's perfect.

**Cultural Lens**  
Did you know? In Roman times, *patria potestas* gave fathers life-or-death power over kids—like absolute quarterback control—making Ephesians' call to gentle discipline a radical counterpunch.

**Anchor Text**  
*Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.* (Ephesians 6:4, ESV)  
*And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? “My son, do not take lightly the discipline of the Lord...for the Lord disciplines the one he loves.”* (Hebrews 12:5-6, ESV, adapted)

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation)**  
- If "discipline" mirrors God's loving drills, what in your coaching style might provoke resentment instead of growth?  
- Audit your last correction: Did it build perseverance like James 1:3-4, or just exasperation?

**Journaling Prompt**  
I am most afraid that if I follow this playbook with _____, then _____.

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Huddle Up: Run the Heavenly Plays**

From spotting the playbook's tension (Eph 6:4) to wrestling its hard edges, we see God's coaching builds champions through love, not wrath—flawed dads point us to the perfect Father-Coach.

This isn't vague strategy; it's daily drills turning childish fumbles into mature victories, because kids thrive under consistent, sacrificial guidance.

**Anchor Text**  
*These words... shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children.* (Deuteronomy 6:6-7, ESV)

**Living Discovery (Application)**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you say "no" to your child (or envision one), pause, name one character trait it builds (like patience), and affirm God's playbook aloud.

**Breath Prayer**  
Heavenly Coach, drill my heart with Your wisdom—help me lead without crushing, for Your glory.
