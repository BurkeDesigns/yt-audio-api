# Tuning In: A 3-Day Devotional on Renewing Your Mind

*Object Lesson: Imagine your internal radio—blasting static from the world's noise or tuned clear to God's frequency. Over these days, we'll audit the dial together.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER (The Hook & The Book)

**The Static Over Your Signal**

I've chased the high of endless parties and success, only to crash into emptiness, desperate for a signal that lasts. Picture Ryan, globe-trotting pro skater amid playboy chaos, hitting rock bottom in a Panama hotel, whispering a raw prayer for rescue. Have you ever muted your internal radio with noise, wondering if anything real can break through?

**Anchor Text:**  
*Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.* (Romans 12:1-2 NIV)

**The "First Look" (Observation):**  
- What repeated action does this text urge, and how does it clash with "conform"?  
- Notice the progression: from body to mind to will—what chain reaction do you see?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Matthew 6:22-23; 1 John 1:5-7

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE (The Look & The Tension)

**Your Dial's Already Stuck on Static?**

Did you know ancient "world patterns" included idol feasts and emperor worship—echoing today's 9-11 hours of screen static pumping porn, despair, and lies into teen minds every day?

**Anchor Text (Mirror Passage):**  
*Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.* (Ephesians 5:18 NIV)  
*(Echoing Romans 12:1-2's non-conformity through mind renewal.)*

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation):**  
- If renewing your mind means ditching the world's static, what "living sacrifice" in your daily playlist feels impossible to relinquish?  
- Audit your internal radio: Where has garbage in produced garbage out, opening doors you'd rather keep shut?

**The Journaling Prompt:**  
I am most afraid that if I tune out the world's noise for the Spirit's signal, then __________________.

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (The Took & The Life)

**Lock Your Dial on Holy Spirit Power**

From Day 1's raw encounter with the call to renew, through Day 2's wrestle with stuck channels, we see the why: worldly static drowns God's good will, but surrender unleashes transformation. Now, flip the switch—your internal radio craves the Spirit's *dunamis* power to broadcast Christ's life.

**Anchor Text (Sending):**  
*But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses...* (Acts 1:8 NIV)

**The Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time your phone buzzes with noise, pause, close your eyes, and whisper: "Holy Spirit, tune my mind to Your frequency right now."

**The Breath Prayer:**  
Holy Spirit, fill my internal radio with Your clear signal—renew me, empower me, lead me today.

**The Full Map:**  
Romans 12:1-2; Matthew 6:22-23; 1 John 1:5-7; Ephesians 5:18; Acts 1:8
