# 3-Day Devotional: Anchored in the Storm

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**The Storm Hits Hard**  

Imagine your ship suddenly engulfed by towering waves—cargo lost, sails torn, darkness closing in. A trusted captain invited you aboard, yet now the horizon vanishes, and panic rises. Have you ever cried out in the chaos, wondering if rescue is real?  

**Psalm 13 (ESV)**  
*How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?  
How long will you hide your face from me?  
How long must I take counsel in my soul  
and have sorrow in my heart all the day?  
How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?  
Consider and answer me, O Lord my God;  
light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,  
lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,”  
lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.  
But I have trusted in your steadfast love;  
my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.  
I will sing to the Lord,  
because he has dealt bountifully with me.*  

**First Look (Observation):**  
- Notice the four repeated phrases—what pattern builds the desperation?  
- Which word describes the enemy's potential "win," and how does it shift by verse 5?  

**Deepen the Roots:** Psalm 22:1; 1 Corinthians 13:12.

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Waves That Won't Quit**  

Your ship pitches wildly; every "why" feels like another rogue wave crashing over the deck, threatening to swamp you.  

**Did you know?** In Hebrew, David's four "how long" cries (ma'yan) echo ancient laments, like war cries in battle—raw, repetitive agony not weakness, but a sailor's desperate signal flare amid foes who seem to triumph temporarily.  

**Psalm 13 (repeated for the mirror)**  

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- Audit your heart: If God allows enemies to "exalt" for a season, what comfort zone in your life does that threaten?  
- Imagine the pivot in verse 5—what risk does "trusting steadfast love" demand when waves still rage?  

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I am most afraid that if I trust God amid this storm, then ___________________.

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Drop the Anchor Now**  

Relinquish the wheel—secure your ship by dropping anchor into God's unshakeable depths.  

From spotting storm clouds (Day 1) to battling gales (Day 2), we've seen David's raw cries turn to trust. This shift isn't denial; it's defiance, anchoring us to rejoice amid partial sight (1 Corinthians 13:12).  

**Isaiah 51:12 (ESV)**  
*I, I am he who comforts you;  
who are you that you are afraid of man who dies,  
of the son of man who is made like grass...?*  

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time a wave of worry hits (like checking news), pause, place your hand over your heart, and declare aloud: "I trust your steadfast love."  

**Breath Prayer:**  
As waves crash, breathe in: "I have trusted"; breathe out: "in your steadfast love."  

**The Full Map:**  
Psalm 13; Psalm 22:1; 1 Corinthians 13:12; Isaiah 51:12.
