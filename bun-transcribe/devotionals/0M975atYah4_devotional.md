# A Tale of Two Gardens

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**The Allure of the First Garden**

Imagine strolling through a lush garden, every flower perfect, air thick with promise—until one tree gleams unnaturally, whispering "just one taste won't hurt." You reach out, bite, and suddenly thorns snag your hands, toil replaces ease, and paradise cracks. Have you ever chased a shiny promise that left you hiding in shame?  

**Anchor Text:**  
*And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."* (Genesis 2:16-17, NKJV)  

**First Look:**  
- What repeated word about eating grabs your attention, and why might it echo like a heartbeat?  
- Notice the promise tied to disobedience—what single outcome dominates the warning?  

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Romans 5:12; Psalm 51:5  

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**The Second Garden's Shocking Silence**

That first garden's thorns cursed us all—yet what if death's final garden held no body, no fruit of sin's wage?  

**Cultural Lens:** Did you know the Garden Tomb was a fresh, rock-cut grave near a skull-shaped hill (Golgotha), owned by Joseph of Arimathea—echoing Eden's "very good" start, but now angels guard an empty promise?  

**Anchor Text:**  
*Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. So there they laid Jesus.* (John 19:41-42, NKJV)  
*Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early... and saw that the stone had been taken away.* (John 20:1, NKJV)  

**Heart-Sift:**  
- If thorns crowned Jesus as our curse-bearer, what inherited "fruit" from Eden are you still clutching?  
- Audit your heart: What "shiny serpent" whispers make God's command feel too restrictive?  

**Journaling Prompt:**  
I am most afraid that if I relinquish control of \_\_\_\_\_, then \_\_\_\_\_.  

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**Walk the Redeemed Garden Path**

From Day 1's tempting tree to Day 2's empty tomb, we've traced thorns from curse to conquered death—because Jesus didn't just reverse Eden; He replanted paradise in us. Now we choose: hide in shame or step into life.  

**Anchor Text:**  
*Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."* (John 14:6, NKJV)  

**Living Discovery:**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you see a plant or flower, pause, touch a leaf, and whisper, "Thorns lost; life won."  

**Breath Prayer:**  
Inhale: "From curse to crown..." Exhale: "...I step free."
