# Carrying the King's Treasure: A 3-Day Devotional

*We're fellow carriers here—I've botched holy hauls too. This series uses "Carrying the King's Treasure" (the Ark, God's presence) as our anchor: shoulders for reverence, not a casual cart. Let's discover together.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**The Risk of a Casual Haul**

Imagine lugging your grandma's irreplaceable crystal on a wobbly wagon over potholes—crash imminent. David tried that with God's Ark first: ox cart, quick fix, deadly zap. Have you ever shoved a sacred thing onto your terms?

**Anchor Text:**  
*1 Chronicles 15:13*  
"It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the Lord our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way." So the Levites consecrated themselves... (NIV)

**First Look (Observation):**  
1. Which phrase pins the first failure squarely?  
2. Notice the shift—who's now on the hook for the carry?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
- Exodus 25:14-15 (pole rules for the Ark).  
- 1 Chronicles 13:9-10 (Uzzah's touch).

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**The Burn of Shoulder Carry**

Did you know the Ark—acacia wood, gold-overlaid, tiny (3.75x2.25 ft)—held the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, manna? Touching it casually? Instant death. Levites alone, poles in, shoulders straining. Surprising weight for glory.

**Anchor Text:**  
*1 Chronicles 15:13* (repeated) + *1 Chronicles 14:10*  
"David inquired of God: 'Shall I go and attack the Philistines? ...' The Lord answered him, 'Go, I will hand them over to you.'" (NIV)

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
1. Audit your battles: What "Philistine raid" are you charging without inquiring God's "prescribed way"?  
2. If shoulder carry demands consecration (baths, purity), what casual habit in your worship deserves the axe?

**Journaling Prompt:**  
Finish: "I'm resisting shoulder carry for God's treasure because if I inquire first, I'll have to relinquish _____."

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Shoulders High: Joy in the Haul**

From cart-crash fear to shoulder-steady joy, David wrestled reverence into rhythm—God's presence isn't hauled, it's honored. Why carry right? It unleashes breakthroughs and dances none can despise.

**Anchor Text (Sending):**  
*1 Chronicles 15:25*  
"David and the elders of Israel... went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord... with shouts of joy..." (NIV)

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you shoulder your bag or phone, pause, plant your feet, and inquire aloud: "Lord, your prescribed way for this moment?"

**Breath Prayer:**  
"King of the treasure, steady my shoulders for your glory—today."

**The Full Map:**  
- 1 Chronicles 14:10; 15:13, 25.  
- Exodus 25:14-15; 1 Chronicles 13:9-10.
