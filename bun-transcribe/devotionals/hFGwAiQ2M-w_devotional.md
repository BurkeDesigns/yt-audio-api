# Unwrapping the Magi's Gifts: A 3-Day Journey

## Day 1: The Encounter  
**The Hook:** *Strangers Bearing Treasures for a Toddler King*

Imagine astronomers from a distant empire, charting stars for kings, dropping everything to trek across deserts with priceless gifts. They bypass palaces, following a mysterious light to a humble house in a forgotten village. Have you ever chased a sign that led you somewhere utterly ordinary yet felt electric with promise?

**The Anchor Text:**  
*When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.* (Matthew 2:10-11, ESV)

**The "First Look" (Observation):**  
- What details about the Magi's actions stand out as they enter the house?  
- Which gift feels most out of place for a child, and why might that word choice matter?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
- Daniel 5:11 (ancient astrologers meet a prophet).  
- Isaiah 60:6 (future kings with gold and frankincense).

## Day 2: The Wrestle  
**The Challenge:** *Pagan Priests Worshiping God in a Baby?*

**The Cultural Lens:** Did you know? The Magi were Zoroastrian priests from Persia—pagan stargazers and dream readers, likely shaped by Daniel's exile centuries earlier—yet they alone spotted "His star" and pursued the Jewish King.

**The Anchor Text:**  
*When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.* (Matthew 2:10-11)  
*Mirror Passage:* *For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.* (Colossians 2:9)

**The "Heart-Sift" (Interpretation):**  
- If these outsiders recognized something divine in Jesus through gold (kingship), frankincense (priesthood), and myrrh (sacrifice), what part of your life resists unwrapping Him that way?  
- Notice the star's role—how does it challenge your expectation of who gets to find Jesus first?

**The Journaling Prompt:**  
Finish this sentence: "I hesitate to offer Jesus my ________ because it might demand I relinquish ________."

## Day 3: The Transformation  
**The Invitation:** *Crown Him King, Priest, and Lamb—Starting Now*

From Day 1's curious peek at the Magi's treasures to Day 2's wrestle with their shocking target, we've unwrapped gold for His unchallenged rule, frankincense for His endless prayers on our behalf, and myrrh for His death that swallows ours. These gifts aren't museum pieces; they're invitations to live under His deity, duty, and sacrifice.

**The Anchor Text:**  
*He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily... He did this once for all when he offered up himself.* (Hebrews 7:27)

**The Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you handle money (gold echo), light a candle or smell incense (frankincense nod), or touch a bandage (myrrh hint), pause and name one area where Jesus rules, prays, or redeems you aloud.

**The Breath Prayer:**  
"Jesus, my King, Priest, and Sacrifice—unwrap my life for Your glory today."
