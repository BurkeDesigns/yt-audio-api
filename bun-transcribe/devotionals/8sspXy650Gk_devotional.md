# 3-Day Devotional: The Walk in Fresh Clothes

*Object Lesson:* Picture your faith as a daily walk after a shower—clean start, but the real test is your clothes. Grab the old, stained rags from the floor, or slip into fresh, fitted gear that lets you stride with purpose? We'll track this wardrobe choice across three days.

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**Caught Wearing Yesterday's Rags?**

I once bolted out the door post-shower, yanking on crumpled work clothes from the hamper—reeking of stress, chafing all day. Everyone noticed; I felt exposed. Have you ever launched into your day dressed for yesterday's mess, not today's calling?  

**Anchor Text:**  
Ephesians 4:1-3  
*I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.*  

**First Look (Observation):**  
1. Notice Paul's opening label—what weight does "prisoner for the Lord" add to his "walk" urging?  
2. Which phrase in this "worthy walk" list packs the heaviest emotional punch for you?  

**Deepen the Roots:**  
Ephesians 3:18-19; Romans 1:6

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Those Old Rags Still Fit Too Well**

**Did you know?** In Greek, "walk" (*peripateo*) meant your everyday strut—your default habits under Roman rule, where Paul penned this from chains, urging freedom in captivity.  

**Anchor Text:**  
Ephesians 4:17, 20-24  
*Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds... But that is not the way you learned Christ!—assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him... to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.*  

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
1. Audit your stride: What "futile" old-rag habit from your unrenewed days keeps snagging your walk?  
2. If "putting on the new self" mirrors Christ's righteousness, what does it make you want to relinquish from your current closet?  

**Journaling Prompt:**  
"I cling to this old clothing of _____ because relinquishing it might mean _____. "

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Stride Out Dressed for the King**

We've spotted the worthy walk's fresh call (Day 1), wrestled the pull of old rags (Day 2). Now, clothed anew, your steps redeem evil days—why? Because your King's wardrobe equips you to walk *His* way.  

**Anchor Text:**  
Ephesians 5:15-17  
*Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.*  

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, post-shower, physically hold up one outfit item and declare aloud: "I shed [name old rag, e.g., bitterness]; I don [new gear, e.g., gentleness]"—then wear it into your day.  

**Breath Prayer:**  
"Lord, as I walk, dress me fresh in your wisdom and love."  

**The Full Map:**  
Ephesians 4:1-3, 17, 20-24; 5:15-17; Ephesians 3:18-19; Romans 1:6; Ephesians 5:1-2, 8-11.
