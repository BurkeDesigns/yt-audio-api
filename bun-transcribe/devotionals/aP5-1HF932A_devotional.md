# 3-Day Devotional: Facing Shadow Giants

*Object Lesson: Imagine a "shadow giant"—those massive foes lurking out of sight during your victories and rest. Like the Rephaim giants defeated by David's men or the pride that ambushed David in quiet times, shadow giants strike when guards are down. Over three days, we'll sift them on our own threshing floor of truth.*

## DAY 1: THE ENCOUNTER  
**Victories Others Fight for You**

You crush a project at work, high-fives all around, but in the quiet commute home, envy whispers about the next promotion. Your team handles the heavy lifting, yet a nagging weight settles in your chest. Have you ever celebrated a win only to sense a shadow giant stirring in the silence?

**Anchor Text:**  
*After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued. And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the Rephaim. And he taunted Israel, but Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, struck him down.* (1 Chronicles 20:4-7, ESV)

**First Look (Observation):**  
- Who actually wields the weapons against these giants, and what details about their size or gear stand out most?  
- Notice the repetition of "war" and "descendants"—what tone does it build?

**Deepen the Roots:**  
2 Samuel 21:15-22; Genesis 6:4.

## DAY 2: THE WRESTLE  
**Pride's Census: Counting Shadows**

Those external giants fell to David's crew—but what if the hardest foe hides in your own heart during downtime?

**Cultural Lens:** "Rephaim" weren't just big guys; they traced to Genesis 6's chaotic "fallen ones" (Nephilim lineage), symbols of anti-God rebellion that survived the flood, mocking Israel's inheritance.

**Anchor Text:**  
*Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to number Israel. So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number." But Joab said, "May the Lord add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! ... Why then should my lord require this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?" But the king's word prevailed... God was displeased with this thing...* (1 Chronicles 21:1-7, ESV)

**Heart-Sift (Interpretation):**  
- If Satan "stood up" to provoke pride in a king fresh off easy victories, what "counting" in your life defends your security over God's?  
- Joab resists, yet David pushes—what does that reveal about how shadow giants exploit our downtime?

## DAY 3: THE TRANSFORMATION  
**Sift Your Shadows on the Threshing Floor**

We've spotted shadow giants in others' victories (Day 1) and wrestled pride's deadly count (Day 2). Now relinquish them: confession sifts chaff from grain, unleashing God's mercy where sacrifice lands.

**Anchor Text:**  
*Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."* (1 Chronicles 21:8, ESV)

**Living Discovery (Application):**  
For the next 24 hours, every time you feel pride swell (like checking achievements or comparing), pause, name the shadow giant aloud—"Pride, you don't rule here"—and relinquish it with a deep breath.

**Breath Prayer:**  
Inhale: "Lord, sift my shadows." Exhale: "Your mercy covers me."

**The Full Map:**  
1 Chronicles 20:4-7; 1 Chronicles 21:1-8; 2 Samuel 21:15-22; Genesis 6:4.
