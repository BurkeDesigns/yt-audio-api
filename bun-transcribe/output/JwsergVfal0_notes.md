## Bible Teaching (1 Chronicles 17-20)
- **Ch 17**: David's humble prayer thanking God for unconditional Davidic Covenant (eternal kingdom via Messiah from David's line).
  - Fulfilled in Jesus (descendant of David via Mary/Joseph lineages).
  - Rejects replacement theology; God faithful to Israel forever (contra anti-Semitism).
  - Cross-references: Isaiah 11:1-2 (rod/branch from Jesse/Netzer = Jesus of Nazareth); Rev 22:16.
- **Ch 18**: David's victories expand Israel (Philistines/Gath [Goliath's city: recapture enemy losses]; Moab; Hadadezer/Zobah/Syria; Edom).
  - Plunders gold/bronze/silver for temple (used by Solomon).
  - Cabinet: Joab/Abishai (nephews via sister Zeruiah) as generals.
- **Ch 19**: Ammon (Hanun) humiliates David's messengers (shave/cut clothes); hires mercenaries (Syria/Iraq); defeated by Joab/Abishai/David.
  - Principle: Encourage one another (Joab to Abishai; Heb 10:25).
- **Ch 20**: Joab defeats Rabbah/Ammon; David takes gold crown (~$6M value).
  - Warning: David stays home (ease/idleness → sin; cf. 2 Sam 11 adultery).

**Key Principles**:
- God's covenant faithfulness.
- Recapture what enemy stole.
- Encourage others.
- Beware downtime (Satan exploits idleness/flesh).
