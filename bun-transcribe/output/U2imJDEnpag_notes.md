# Bible Study: Ephesians 5-6 on Healthy Relationships

## Speaker
- Unnamed pastor

## Key Foundation
- Ephesians 5:20-21: Giving thanks always... submitting to one another in the fear of God.
- Covers Eph 5:22-6:9: God's order for harmony in marriage, family, workplace.
- No perfect people; sinful nature defaults to selfishness (selfish, proud, unforgiving, etc.).
- Submit to God first (unconditionally), then others; give grace as all in process.

## Marriage (Eph 5:22-33)
- **Wives**: Submit to husbands as to the Lord (headship like Christ/church); means orderly arrangement (hupotasso), not inferiority (3 verses).
- **Husbands**: Love wives as Christ loves church (unconditional, sacrificial, faithful, enter her world); 9 verses; know wife (1 Pet 3:7); lead with love.
- Summary: Jesus as Lord; husband leads with love; wife submits with respect; both as unto Lord; tiebreaker for impasses on husband.

## Family (Eph 6:1-4)
- **Children**: Obey (hupakouo: listen/heed) and honor parents in the Lord (5th Commandment with promise: long life/well-being).
- **Fathers**: Do not provoke to wrath; train in Lord's discipline/admonition.
- Instill respect for authority; balance discipline with grace.

## Workplace (Eph 6:5-9)
- **Employees (bondservants/doulos)**: Obey employers as to Christ; sincere, not eye-service; good work ethic as unto Lord (rewards regardless of status).
- **Employers**: Treat same way; no threats/partiality (God impartial).
- Leave toxic situations; Christians excel in ethic.

## Closing Caveat
- "In the Lord/as to Lord" prioritizes honoring God; refuse ungodly commands (need strong biblical basis, not whims).

## Prayer Points
- Grace for imperfect roles; heal strained marriages/families; honor in work; submit in fear of God.
