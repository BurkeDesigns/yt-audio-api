# Bible Study Notes: Ephesians 5-6 Relationships

## Speaker
Unnamed pastor

## Foundational Principle
- Ephesians 5:20-21: Give thanks always; submit to one another in fear of God.
- Covers Eph 5:22-6:9: God's order for harmony in marriage, family, workplace.
- Submission starts with God (not conditional on others); overcome sinful nature (selfish, proud, unforgiving).
- All imperfect; extend grace; prioritize submission to Lord.

## Marriage (Eph 5:22-33)
- **Wives**: Submit to husbands as to Lord (headship like Christ/church); means orderly arrangement (hupotasso), not inferiority.
- **Husbands**: Love wives as Christ loves church (9 verses vs. 3 for wives):
  - Unconditionally, sacrificially, faithfully.
  - Nourish/cherish as own body; enter her world; dwell with knowledge (1 Pet 3:7).
- Summary: Jesus as Lord; husband leads with love; wife submits with respect—as unto Lord.
- Tiebreaker: Husband leads at impasse; pray for each other.

## Family (Eph 6:1-4)
- **Children**: Obey/honor parents in Lord (hupakouo = listen/heed); 5th Commandment with promise (long life/well-being).
- Instill respect for authority early; no "time-outs" without discipline.
- **Fathers**: Do not provoke to wrath; train in Lord's admonition (spiritual leaders).

## Workplace (Eph 6:5-9)
- **Employees** (bondservants/doulos = voluntary servants): Obey employers as Christ; sincere heart, not eye-service; as unto Lord (rewards regardless of status).
  - Best work ethic; leave if unworkable.
- **Employers** (masters): Treat same way; no threats/partiality (God impartial).

## Key Caveat
- Obey "in everything/as to Lord" unless dishonors God (need strong biblical basis, not whims).

## Closing Prayer
- For marriages, families, workplaces: Honor God, extend grace, submit mutually.
