# Sermon Notes: Paul's Thorn in the Flesh (2 Corinthians 12)

## Background
- Paul recounts vision of heaven 14 years prior, possibly during stoning in Lystra.
- Written in third person to defend apostleship against Corinth critics.
- Shifts from revelations to trials as greater proof of character.

## Scripture Focus
- **2 Corinthians 12:7-10** (NKJV): Thorn given to prevent pride from revelations; "messenger of Satan" to buffet; prayed 3x for removal; God's response: "My grace is sufficient... strength perfect in weakness"; Paul boasts in infirmities, takes pleasure in weaknesses for Christ's sake ("when weak, then strong").

## Nature of Thorn
- Unknown: Possibly eye disease (prevented travel, Galatia preaching; "tear out eyes"; large letters); migraine aura; or opposition.
- Severe: Greek *skolops* = stake/tent peg for impaling; harass/torment.
- Source: Satan-sent but God-allowed (sovereign; cf. Job).

## THORN Acronym: Godly Response to Trials
- **T**eachable: Lessons in perseverance, character, hope, God's love (trials reveal depth of love).
- **H**umble: Prevents exaltation/pride (highs for hope, lows for humility).
- **O**riented to heaven/prayer: Crisis boosts prayer life, brings peace.
- **R**eliant on grace/strength: Less self-reliant, more God-dependent.
- **N**ear Jesus: Weakness fosters closeness; "pleasure" in infirmities.

## Examples
- Joni Eareckson Tada: Quadriplegic 50+ years post-diving accident; breast cancer; views suffering as gift ("God allows what He hates to accomplish what He loves").
- Fanny Crosby: Blind from infancy; wrote 8,000+ hymns; called blindness God's gift for eternal sight of Savior.

## Closing Prayer
- For grace/strength in trials; perseverance until heaven.
