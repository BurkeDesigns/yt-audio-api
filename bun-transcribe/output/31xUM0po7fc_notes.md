# Sermon: Paul's Thorn in the Flesh (2 Corinthians 12)

## Context and Background

- Finishes 2 Corinthians (focus on ch. 12; ch. 13 farewell).
- Follows Paul's heavenly vision/revelation (14 years prior; possibly from stoning in Acts 14 at Lystra; in/out of body uncertain).
- Written to defend apostleship against Corinthian doubts.
- Thorn given post-revelations to prevent pride/exaltation.
- Trials define Christian character more than visions.

## Key Scripture (2 Corinthians 12:7-10, NKJV)

- Thorn in flesh: "messenger of Satan" to buffet/harass/torment, lest exalted.
- Pleaded 3x for removal; God: "My grace is sufficient... strength perfect in weakness."
- Paul boasts in infirmities; takes pleasure in them (infirmities, reproaches, needs, persecutions, distresses) for Christ's power; "when weak, then strong."

## Nature of Thorn

- Unknown exactly; educated guesses:
  - Eye disease/ailment (Galatians 4 illness delayed travel; desire to give eyes; large letters in Galatians 6:11; possible migraine with aura per NIH article).
  - External opposition (beatings, etc.).
- Vague intentionally: represents any painful trial (physical, emotional, spiritual).
- Greek _skolops_: stake/tent peg/impaling stake (severe, not rose thorn).
- Source: Satan, but God sovereignly allows (like Job: Satan afflicts with God's permission for greater good).

## Godly Response to Suffering (THORN Acronym)

- **T**eachable: Trials as lessons (not always corrective, often instructive of God's love); glory in tribulations (produces perseverance, character, hope).
- **H**umble: Prevents pride (highs for hope, lows for humility); better self-humble than God-imposed.
- **O**riented to heaven/prayer: Crisis boosts prayer life; Paul pleaded 3x, accepted God's peace/grace.
- **R**eliant: On God's grace/strength, not self (boast in weakness for Christ's power).
- **N**ear Jesus: Cherish trials keeping close to Him; "take pleasure" in weaknesses.

## Examples of Perseverance

- Joni Eareckson Tada: Quadriplegic 50+ years (diving accident), breast cancer; calls suffering "gift"; "God allows what He hates to accomplish what He loves" (closeness to Him).
- Fanny Crosby: Blind from 6 weeks; wrote 8,000+ hymns; viewed blindness as gift for future sight of Savior.

## Closing

- Prayer for those in trials: God's grace/strength sufficient; perseverance to glory.
