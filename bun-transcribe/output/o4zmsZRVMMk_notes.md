# Sermon Notes: 1 Chronicles 16-17

## Introduction
- David's song after bringing Ark to Jerusalem; establishes God as central.
- Prophetic reference to Lord's second coming as fierce warrior on white horse (King of kings, Lord of lords), contrasting first coming (meek on donkey).

## Biblical Covenants Reviewed
- **Definition**: Solemn, grace-based agreement by God; conditional (human obedience) or unconditional (God's sovereignty).
- Six major covenants:
  - Adam: Conditional (be fruitful; do not eat from tree).
  - Noah: Unconditional (no more global flood; rainbow sign).
  - Abraham: Unconditional (people, land for Messiah; Gen 12, 15).
  - Moses: Law (conditional).
  - David: Unconditional (ch 17).
  - New: Jesus' blood for sin forgiveness.

## David's Psalm (1 Chronicles 16)
- **Verses 8-22**: Parallels Psalm 105:1-15; thanks, covenant recall (v15: Abrahamic).
- **Verses 23-33**: Parallels Psalm 96; praise God, declare glory; world established; Lord comes to judge earth (prophetic of second coming).
- **Verses 34-36**: Parallels Psalm 106:1, Psalm 106:47-48; thanks for mercy; communal "Amen" (means "truly" or "so be it").

## Ministry Assignments (1 Chron 16:37-43)
- Asaph/brothers: Minister before Ark daily.
- Obed-Edom (68 brethren), Hosa: Gatekeepers.
- Zadok/priests: Offerings at Gibeon tabernacle (5.5 miles NW of Jerusalem).
- Hemam, Jeduthun: Thanks with music/trumpets/cymbals.
- Ark in Jerusalem tent; full tabernacle/sacrifices at Gibeon until Solomon's temple.

## God's Covenant with David (1 Chron 17:1-14)
- David desires cedar house for Ark (lives in luxury palace).
- Nathan initially approves; God corrects: David won't build; God never asked.
- God recounts: Took David from sheepfold, defeated enemies, gives Israel rest.
- **Promise**: God builds David's "house" (lineage/dynasty).
  - Solomon builds temple (literal house).
  - Eternal throne/kingdom through David's seed (unconditional).
- **Davidic Covenant**: Messiah (Jesus) from David's line/tribe of Judah; eternal kingdom based on God's faithfulness.

## Fulfillment in Jesus
- Legal claim via Joseph (Solomon line, Matthew 1) and blood via Mary (Nathan line, Luke 3).
- Messianic prophecy: Jesus rules with iron rod (Rev 19).

## Closing
- God outdoes human efforts; covenant-keeping God.
- Next: 1 Chron 17:15+.
