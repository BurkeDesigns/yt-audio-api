# Sermon Summary: 1 Chronicles 16-17

## Introduction
- Lord's second coming: Fierce warrior on white horse (Rev 19), King of kings, Lord of lords; contrasts first coming on donkey (meek, for salvation).
- Opportunity for mercy now; justice coming.

## Context: David's Song (1 Chron 16)
- David king over Israel; brings Ark to Jerusalem (tent); sings psalm of thanks.
- Vs 8-22 mirrors Ps 105:1-15 (covenant with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob: land promise).
- Vs 20-22: God protected Israel from harm.
- Vs 23-33 mirrors Ps 96: Call to worship, proclaim salvation; Lord made heavens; He comes to judge earth (prophetic of second coming).

## Biblical Covenants Review
- Covenant: Solemn God-initiated agreement (conditional or unconditional, grace-based).
- Six major:
  - Adam: Conditional (obey, no tree; broken, restored in Christ).
  - Noah: Unconditional (no global flood; rainbow sign).
  - Abraham: Unconditional (people/land for Messiah; Gen 12,15).
  - Moses: Law (conditional).
  - David: Unconditional (dynasty; ch 17).
  - New: Jesus' blood (forgiveness for believers).

## Worship Organization (1 Chron 16:37-43)
- Asaph/brothers: Minister before Ark daily.
- Obed-Edom (68 brethren), Hosa: Gatekeepers.
- Zadok/priests: At Gibeon tabernacle (burnt offerings morning/evening).
- Heman, Jeduthun: Thanks, trumpets, cymbals.
- People depart; David blesses house.
- Note: Ark in Jerusalem tent; rest of tabernacle at Gibeon (5.5 mi NW).

## God's Covenant with David (1 Chron 17:1-14)
- David in cedar palace; wants house for Ark.
- Nathan initially approves; God corrects: David won't build (God nomadic in tents).
- God: Took David from sheepfold, defeated enemies, appoints Israel place.
- Promise: **Builds David's "house" (lineage/dynasty)**.
  - David's seed (Solomon) builds temple.
  - Throne/kingdom forever (unconditional).
- Davidic Covenant: Messiah (Jesus) from David's line/tribe Judah; eternal kingdom; based on God's faithfulness.

## Key Details
- "House": Literal (palace/temple) or lineage.
- Jesus' genealogies: Mary (Luke 3, via Nathan); Joseph (Matt 1, via Solomon; legal father).
- Fulfilled in Jesus: Salvation for world.
- Solomon builds temple (David's hands bloody from war).

## Closing
- Prayer: Thanks for covenants, David's fulfillment in Jesus, new covenant.
