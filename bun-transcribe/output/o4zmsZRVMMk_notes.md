# Sermon Notes: 1 Chronicles 16-17

## Opening and Prayer
- Speaker emphasizes Lord's fierce second return (Rev 19) vs. merciful first coming; opportunity to repent.
- Prayer for God's word to speak to hearts.
- David established as king; brings Ark to Jerusalem, sings psalm of thanks (1 Chron 16 parallels Ps 105:1-15, Ps 96:23-33, Ps 106:1,47-48).

## Review of Biblical Covenants
- **Definition**: Solemn, grace-based agreement by God; conditional (obedience required) or unconditional (God's sovereignty).
- **Six Major Covenants**:
  - Adam: Conditional (be fruitful; do not eat from tree).
  - Noah: Unconditional (no more global flood; rainbow sign).
  - Abraham: Unconditional (people, land for Messiah; Gen 12,15).
  - Moses: Conditional (law).
  - David: Unconditional (dynasty, Messiah from his line).
  - New: Jesus' blood for forgiveness (conditional on faith).

## David's Psalm Highlights (1 Chron 16)
- Protection of patriarchs (v20-22).
- Call to worship, declare God's glory (v23-33).
- Prophecy: Lord comes to judge earth (second coming, not first; cf. John 3:17, 12:47).
- Thanks for mercy (v34-36); communal "Amen" (means "truly" or "so be it").

## Worship Assignments
- Asaph and brothers: Minister before Ark daily.
- Obed-Edom (68 brethren), Hosa: Gatekeepers.
- Zadok and priests: Sacrifices at Gibeon tabernacle (5.5 miles NW of Jerusalem).
- Hemam, Jeduthun: Thanks, music (trumpets, cymbals).
- People depart; David blesses his house.

## God's Covenant with David (1 Chron 17:1-14; Unconditional #5)
- David in cedar palace; wants temple for Ark (under tent). Nathan initially approves, but God corrects.
- God: Never asked for house; took David from sheepfold, gave victories, land security.
- Promise: Build David's "house" (lineage/dynasty), not vice versa.
  - Solomon builds temple.
  - Throne/kingdom forever (messianic: Messiah from David's line/tribe of Judah).
  - Fulfilled in Jesus (legal via Joseph/Solomon; blood via Mary/Nathan; Matt 1, Luke 3).
- Forever emphasis refutes replacement theology.

## Closing Prayer
- Thanks for covenants, Jesus' fulfillment; God outdoes human efforts.
