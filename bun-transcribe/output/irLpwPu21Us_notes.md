# Bible Study: 2 Kings 17-18

## Opening
- Midweek service prayer for refreshment, healing, and Word ministry.
- Resume from 2 Kings 17:34.

## Historical Context
- Assyrian Empire (Iran/Iraq region) conquers Northern Kingdom (Israel, 10 tribes) in 723 BC under King Hoshea.
- Assyrians deport elites, leave poor, import foreigners; intermarriage creates Samaritans (Assyrian-Jewish mix).
- Jewish-Samaritan prejudice (e.g., Luke 9:51-56: disciples want fire on Samaritans; John 4: woman at well).
- Modern Samaritans (~800): Reject post-Pentateuch OT; worship on Mt. Gerizim; mixed beliefs (e.g., Eden, Ark, Abraham there); bilingual (Arabic/Hebrew); neutral ID.

## 2 Kings 17:34-41
- Assyrians/imports mix worship: fear Lord (after lions sent) but serve idols; insincere, rote rituals persist across generations.
- Compromised priests returned from exile fail to teach true worship.

## 2 Kings 18: Hezekiah (Southern Kingdom, Judah)
- Reigns 29 years from age 25; does right like David.
- Reforms: Removes high places, breaks pillars/images, destroys Nehushtan (bronze serpent from Numbers 21, idolized after 700 years).
- Trusts/holds fast to Lord; unique among Judah kings.
- Assyria (Shalmaneser V, then Sennacherib) falls Northern Kingdom (repeat); advances south, takes Judah cities.
- Hezekiah pays massive tribute (300 talents silver, 30 gold); strips temple gold.
- Assyrian officials (Tartan, Rabsaris, Rabshakeh) threaten Jerusalem; mock trust in Egypt/Lord, claim divine commission.
- Judah officials request Aramaic; Rabshakeh speaks Hebrew to intimidate people.
- Promises peace/prosperity if surrender; boasts conquests.
- People silent per Hezekiah's command; officials report to king (torn clothes).

## Key Principles
- Even good things (e.g., bronze serpent) can become idols.
- Sin has consequences; God disciplines those He loves.
- Don't surrender to enemy or trade sacred (temple) for secular (tribute).
- Hold peace against false accusations; let God defend.
