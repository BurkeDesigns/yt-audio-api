## Service Overview
- Wednesday night Bible study at Cornerstone Chapel.
- Speaker: Unnamed pastor/preacher.
- Focus: Continuation from 2 Kings 17:34; transition to 2 Kings 18.
- Opening: Advice to hold peace against false accusations; let God defend (echoed at end).
- Prayer for refreshment, ministry through Word.

## Historical Context
- Assyrian Empire (Iran/Iraq region) dominant ~723 BC.
- Northern Kingdom (Israel, 10 tribes) conquered by Assyria under Hoshea (last king); people deported, Assyrians imported.
- Remnant (poor) intermarried with Assyrians → Samaritans (mixed race).
- Result: Idolatry persisted; God sent lions as judgment; compromised priest sent back.

## Samaritans Background
- Prejudice: Jews viewed as "half-breeds"; mutual hostility (Luke 9:51-56: disciples want fire on Samaritans; John 4: woman at well).
- Beliefs/practices: Accept only Pentateuch; temple on Mt. Gerizim; altered stories (Eden, Ark, Isaac sacrifice there).
- Today: ~800 left; speak Arabic/Hebrew; neutral ID; closed community.

## 2 Kings 17:34-41
- Mixed worship: Feared God superficially (due to lions) but served idols/former rituals.
- Ignored covenant: No fear of other gods; continued as ancestors.

## 2 Kings 18: Hezekiah (King of Judah)
- Name: "Strength of God"; reigned 29 years from age 25; did right like David.
- Reforms: Removed high places, broke pillars/images, destroyed bronze serpent (Nehushtan; idolized from Numbers 21 event).
- Trusted God uniquely among Judah kings; held fast to commandments.
- Assyrian advance: Shalmaneser V took Samaria (6th yr Hezekiah); Sennacherib took Judah cities.
- Hezekiah's compromise: Paid massive tribute (300 talents silver, 30 gold); stripped temple doors/gold.
- Rabshakeh's intimidation at Jerusalem:
  - Mocked trust in Egypt ("broken reed"), Hezekiah's reforms, God.
  - Offered horses, better land; claimed other gods failed; invoked Yahweh falsely.
  - Spoke Hebrew despite request for Aramaic (to avoid scaring people).
- Response: People silent per Hezekiah's command; officials reported with torn clothes.

## Key Principles
- Even good things (e.g., bronze serpent) can become idols.
- Sin has consequences; God disciplines those He loves.
- Don't surrender to enemy or trade sacred (temple gold) for secular.
- Hold peace against false accusations; let God defend.
