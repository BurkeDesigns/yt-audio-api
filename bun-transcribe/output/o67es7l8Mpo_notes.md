# Bible Study: 1 Chronicles 14-15

## Background & Recap
- David established as king over all Israel after 7 years in Hebron.
- Conquers Jebus (renames Jerusalem, capital).
- Seeks to centralize worship by bringing Ark of the Covenant (symbol of God's presence between cherubim) to Jerusalem.
- Prior failed attempt (ch. 13): Ark on ox cart (not per Mosaic law); Uzzah dies touching it; Ark stays 3 months at Obed-Edom's house (blessed); David pauses to correct method.

## 1 Chronicles 14
### Hiram's Alliance
- Hiram (king of Tyre) sends cedar, masons, carpenters to build David's house.

### David's Recognition & Family
- David knows Lord established his exalted kingdom for Israel's sake.
- Takes more wives in Jerusalem; begets sons/daughters: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Eliphelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, Eliphelet.
- Weakness: Violates Deut 17 (kings not to multiply wives; God designs one man, one woman).

### Victories Over Philistines
- Philistines raid Valley of Rephaim to attack David.
- David inquires of God twice:
  - First: "Go up"; victory at Baal-perazim ("Lord of breakthrough"); Philistines abandon idols, burned per Deut 7.
  - Second: Circle, attack opposite mulberry trees when sound of marching heard (God goes before); rout from Gibeon to Gezer (~17 miles).
- Principle: When enemy pursues, fight on knees (inquire of God); spiritual warfare real (Satan attacks via minions).
- David's fame spreads; fear of him on nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15
### Preparations for Ark
- David builds houses in City of David; pitches tent for Ark (acacia wood/gold overlaid, 3.75x2.25x2.25 ft; contains Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, manna; mercy seat with cherubim).
- Correct transport: Levites carry on shoulder poles (not cart).
- Gathers Israel; assembles Levites/priests: chiefs Uriel (120), Asaiah (220), Joel (130), Shemaiah (200), Eliel (80), Amminadab (112); Zadok, Abiathar.
- Levites sanctify: ceremonial baths (mikvah), clean linen garments (no wool), abstain from sex (per Ex 19), sin/burnt offerings.
- Appoints musicians: Heman, Asaph, Ethan (sons of Joel/Berechiah/Kushaiah); Cananiah (music leader); trumpeters (Berechiah, etc.); doorkeepers (Obed-Edom, Jehiah).

### Procession
- Joyful: shouting, horns, trumpets, cymbals, harps, stringed instruments.
- David wears linen ephod/robe (not royal; blends as common worshiper; only God is King).
- Offer 7 bulls/7 rams.
- Michal (Saul's daughter, David's wife) despises David dancing (undignified); absent from procession (per 2 Sam 6:23, barren till death).

## Key Principles
- Worship God-centric (not me-centric; critiques modern songs like "Made for More").
- Prioritize Scripture obedience, prayer in battle, reverence for holy things.
