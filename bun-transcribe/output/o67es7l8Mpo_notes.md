# Bible Study: 1 Chronicles 14-15

## Background
- David established as king over all Israel; Jerusalem as capital (renamed from Jebus).
- David's heart for worship: Aims to centralize God by bringing Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
- Recap Ch. 13: Failed transport on cart; Uzzah dies for touching Ark; stored at Obed-Edom's house (blessed for 3 months).

## 1 Chronicles 14
- Hiram (king of Tyre) sends cedar, masons, carpenters to build David's house.
- David recognizes Lord's establishment of his kingdom.
- David takes more wives (weakness, violates Deut. 17); lists children: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Eliphelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, Eliphelet.
- Philistines attack Valley of Rephaim:
  - David inquires of God twice; obeys instructions.
  - Victories: Baal-perazim ("Lord of breakthrough"); second ambush at mulberry trees.
  - Burns Philistine idols (per Deut. 7).
- David's fame spreads; fear of him on nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15
- David prepares tent for Ark in City of David.
- Ark details: Acacia wood/gold overlaid; mercy seat with cherubim; contains Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, manna; God's presence dwells there.
- Correct transport: Levites carry on poles (not cart).
- Gathers Israel, Levites (lists chiefs: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, Amminadab; Zadok, Abiathar priests).
- Levites sanctify: Ceremonial baths, clean linens, abstain from sex, sin/burnt offerings.

- Joyful procession: Shouting, music, sacrifices (7 bulls, 7 rams).
- David wears linen ephod (humbles as common man).
- Michal (Saul's daughter, David's wife) despises David for "undignified" worship.
