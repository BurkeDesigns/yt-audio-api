# Sermon: Faith vs. Works in Galatians 3

## Scripture Reading
- Galatians 3:1-14 (NKJV)

## Context
- Paul writes corrective letter to Galatian churches (modern Turkey) against Judaizers.
- Judaizers: Jewish believers adding Mosaic law (circumcision, feasts, kosher) to faith in Jesus for salvation ("Jesus plus").
- Core truth: Salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone; works cannot save.

## Paul's Arguments Against Law for Righteousness
- **Abraham justified by faith, pre-law**: Abraham (father of Jews) lived 430 years before Moses/law; righteous because he believed God's promise (Gen 15:1-6).
  - God promised descendants like stars; Abraham (age 75) believed despite childlessness; fulfilled at 100 with Isaac.
- **Law condemns all**: No one keeps all 613 commandments perfectly; breaking one = guilty of all (James 2:10); under curse (Deut 28).
  - Quotes: Deut (curse for not obeying all), Habakkuk 2:4 ("just shall live by faith").

## Christ's Redemption
- Jesus became curse for us ("hung on a tree" = cross; Deut 21:23).
- Blessing of Abraham (righteousness by faith) extends to Gentiles via Spirit through faith (Gal 3:14; 2 Cor 5:21).

## Purpose of the Law (Gal 3:19-24)
- **Explains God's righteous standard**: Defines right/wrong (e.g., Rom 7:7); contrasts unchanging God with shifting culture (Isa 5).
- **Exposes sin**: Like mirror showing dirt but not cleaning (Gal 3:22; Job 13:23).
- **Tutor to Christ (paidagogos)**: Guards, leads to faith in Jesus; obsolete post-faith (Gal 3:23-24).

## Closing Prayer Emphasis
- Law reveals standard, sin, need for Savior; Jesus alone saves via faith in His death.
