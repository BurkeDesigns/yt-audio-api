# Sermon: Galatians 3 - Faith, Not Works, for Salvation

## Core Message
- Christianity: God comes to us via Christ; other religions require human effort to reach God.
- Salvation by grace through faith alone in Christ; law cannot save or justify.

## Context
- Paul writes corrective letter to Galatian churches (modern Turkey) against Judaizers.
- Judaizers: Jews who believed in Jesus + Mosaic law (circumcision, feasts, kosher) for true salvation, especially Gentiles.

## Paul's Rebuke (Galatians 3:1-14)
- Calls Galatians "foolish" (not thinking; bewitched from truth of crucified Christ).
- Questions: Spirit received by law works or hearing faith? Perfected by flesh after starting in Spirit? Suffered in vain?
- Miracles by law or faith?
- Abraham justified by faith, not law (predates law by 430 years); blesses all nations via faith.

## Two Arguments Law Cannot Save/Justify
1. **Abraham Righteous Without Law**: Believed God's promise (descendants like stars); faith credited as righteousness.
2. **Law Condemns**: 613 commands; break one = guilty of all, under curse (no one justified by law; just live by faith).

## Christ's Redemption
- Jesus became curse for us (hung on tree/cross), redeeming from law's curse.
- Abraham's blessing (righteousness) to Gentiles via faith; receive Spirit through faith.
- God imputes His righteousness to believers (2 Cor 5:21).

## Purpose of the Law (Galatians 3:19-24)
1. **Reveals God's Righteous Standard**: Defines right/wrong until Christ.
2. **Exposes Sin**: Mirror showing dirtiness (confines all under sin); cannot clean.
3. **Tutor to Christ** (paidagōgos): Guards, leads to faith in Jesus; no longer needed post-faith.

## Closing
- Law moves to Christ; pray for surrender to Jesus for salvation.
