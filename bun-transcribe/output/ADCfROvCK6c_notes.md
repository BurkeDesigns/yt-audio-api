- 2 Corinthians 12:1-6 (NKJV)

## Context

- References hardships from 2 Corinthians 11:22-33 (e.g., 5x 39 lashes, 3x beaten with rods, 1x stoned, 3x shipwrecked, perils, imprisonments).
- Shares vision/revelation from 14 years prior to counter "super apostles."
- Refers to possible near-death in Lystra (Acts 14:19-20): stoned, left for dead, rose after disciples gathered.
- Boasts only in infirmities, not visions; mentions "thorn in the flesh" (to return next week).
- Third heaven: beyond outer space (not layers); heard inexpressible words, unlawful to utter.
