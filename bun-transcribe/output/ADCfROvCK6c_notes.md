# Sermon Notes: The Hope of Heaven

## Speaker
- Pastor Gary

## Primary Scripture
- 2 Corinthians 12:1-6 (Paul's vision/revelation of third heaven 14 years prior; boasts in infirmities, not self)

## Context and Paul's Defense
- Corinthian church doubts Paul's apostleship; he reluctantly lists credentials.
- From 2 Corinthians 11:22-33: Matches "super apostles" as Hebrew/Israelite; exceeds in labors, stripes (5x 39 lashes), prisons, deaths; beaten with rods (3x), stoned (1x), shipwrecked (3x), perils, hardships, escape from Damascus (post-conversion).
- Paul's conversion: Zealous Jew hunting Christians; Jesus confronts him en route to Damascus; blinded 3 days, healed by Ananias, becomes follower.
- Shifts to visions/revelations to affirm credentials; speaks in third person to avoid boasting.
- Thorn in flesh (v7) given to prevent pride; prayed 3x for removal (topic for next week).
- Possible link: Stoned/left for dead in Lystra (Acts 14:19-20); rose after disciples gathered (vision or actual heaven visit? Paul unsure).
- Heard inexpressible words (unlawful to utter); saw/heard unspeakable things in third heaven (beyond outer space: 1st=atmosphere, 2nd=stars, 3rd=God's abode).

## 7 Aspects of Heaven
- Mentioned 275+ times in NT, 300+ in OT (e.g., Isaiah 6, Revelation 4: God on throne, seraphs cry "Holy").
- Habitation of God; eternal home for believers (Psalm 103:19; Isaiah 66:1; 2 Corinthians 5:6-8).
- Above earth, beyond space (Isaiah 55:9; Psalm 103:11).
- Streets of gold, pearl gates, jasper walls, precious stone foundations, crystal river (Revelation 21-22); unimaginable beauty (1 Corinthians 2:9).
- Illuminated by God's glory (no sun/moon/night) (Revelation 21:23).
- No more death, sorrow, crying, pain, sin, sickness (Revelation 21:4).
- Reunions with believing loved ones/friends; recognizable glorified bodies (Matthew 17; John 21).

## Salvation Call
- Assurance of heaven via faith in Christ's death for sins; repent, surrender to Jesus as Lord/Savior.
- Prayer led for forgiveness, new life, assurance.
- Lamb's Book of Life: Only believers enter (Revelation 21:27); Jesus sole way.
