# Philippians: Epistle of Joy

## Sermon Theme
- Joy as underlying constant in relationship with Jesus; worst day with Him > best day without.
- Series: *Reasons to Rejoice* (starting with Phil 1:6: God finishes what He starts).

## Background
- Philippi: Founded 356 BC by Philip II (Macedonia/Greece), Gentile city (10-15k pop), no Jewish presence.
- Paul planted church (2nd journey, 50-53 AD); wrote from Rome prison (62 AD).
- Not corrective/doctrinal; letter of love, gratitude (joy/rejoice: 14x in 4 chapters).

## Paul's Purposes
- Thank for financial support/fellowship in gospel.
- Warn of false teachers.
- Encourage unity of the Spirit.

## Key Scripture: Philippians 1:1-11
- Paul/Timothy (bondservants) to Philippi saints, bishops, deacons.
- Prays with joy for their fellowship; confident God completes good work until day of Jesus Christ.
- Longs for them with Christ's affection; prays love abounds in knowledge/discernment.

## Joy vs. Happiness
- Happiness: Circumstantial/temporal (fleeting).
- Joy: Relational/eternal (transcends circumstances); Greek *chara* = "calm delight" (not fake happiness).

## God Finishes What He Starts (Phil 1:6)
- Paul *confident* (*peitho*: completely convinced).
- God initiates/completes good work: Saves + keeps saved via indwelling Holy Spirit (helper, guide, convicts, comforts).
- Believers' role: Work out salvation with fear/trembling (Phil 2:12), as God works in to will/do (Phil 2:13).
- Until "day of Jesus Christ" (2nd coming or personal death/glory).

## Illustration
