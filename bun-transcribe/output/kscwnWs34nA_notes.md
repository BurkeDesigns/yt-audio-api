## Introduction and Prayer
- Theme: Greater is He in us than he in the world; resist enemy (1 John 4:4 implied; 1 Peter 5:8; James 4:7).
- Prayer for God's Word to speak, referencing Psalm 122:1.

## David's Prayer (1 Chronicles 17:15-27)
- Humble gratitude for Davidic Covenant: Unconditional promise of eternal kingdom through David's lineage (Messiah, Jesus).
- God's faithfulness to Israel forever; rejects replacement theology (Romans 9; Romans 11:25-26).
- Future Jewish salvation post-Tribulation (Zechariah).

## Davidic Covenant Fulfillment
- Jesus' legal/biological descent: Joseph's line (Matthew 1, Solomon); Mary's (Luke 3, Nathan).
- Isaiah 11:1-2: Messiah as branch from Jesse (David's father); Revelation 22:16 confirms Jesus.
- Kingdom endures forever; Jesus reigns now and future (1,000 years in Jerusalem).

## Chapter 18: Victories and Expansion
