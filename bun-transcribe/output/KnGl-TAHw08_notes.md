# Sermon Notes: Ephesians 2:1-10

## Speaker
- Pastor Gary (Cornerstone Chapel)

## Core Message
- Humans are born spiritually dead in sin but made alive by God's mercy, love, and grace through faith in Christ (not works).
- Avoid returning to "dead life"; lean into God's provision.

## Spiritual State Before Christ
- Physically alive, spiritually dead due to inherited sin nature (from Adam).
- Lived according to world, devil, flesh; children of wrath.

## Illustration
- Glove: Lifeless until hand (Holy Spirit) enters, giving purpose.

## 3 Forces Against Life (Eph 2:2-3)
- **World**: Squeezes into its mold via culture/values (e.g., Babylonian renaming of Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego; Nazi indoctrination).
- **Devil**: "Prince of power of air"; uses temptation, condemnation, deception, accusation. Defeated at cross; power only what believers give.
- **Flesh**: Sinful desires (e.g., Gal 5: sexual immorality, idolatry, jealousy, drunkenness).

## 3 Forces for Life (Eph 2:4-7)
- **Mercy**: Rich compassion; withholds deserved punishment.
- **Love**: Great agape (unconditional); everlasting, demonstrated at cross.
- **Grace**: Exceeding riches; gives undeserved blessings (forgiveness, adoption, eternal life).

## Closing
- Altar call: Pray to receive Christ; receive free Bible (in-person or text 703-844-9969 if online).
