# Sermon Notes: Ephesians 2:1-10

## Speaker
- Pastor Gary

## Main Theme
- Humans born physically alive but spiritually dead in sin; God makes us alive through Christ by grace.
- Contrast: Dead life (trespasses/sins) vs. alive in Christ (purpose, heavenly seats, good works).
- Illustration: Glove gains purpose with hand (Holy Spirit in us).

## Three Forces Against Us (Keep Dead)
- **World**: Squeezes into its mold, changes identity (Daniel/Hananiah/Azariah/Meshael in Babylon; Nazi propaganda; Romans 12:2).
- **Devil**: Prince of power of air; tools: temptation, condemnation, deception, accusation (defeated at cross; James 4:7; Colossians 2:15).
- **Flesh**: Sinful nature/desires (Galatians 5 acts: immorality, impurity, idolatry, etc.; Romans 8:12-13).

## Three Forces For Us (Make Alive)
- **Mercy**: Rich compassion; withholds deserved punishment (Psalm 103:8,10).
- **Love**: Great agape; unconditional, demonstrated on cross (Jeremiah 31:3; Romans 5:8).
- **Grace**: Exceeding riches; gives undeserved blessings (forgiveness, adoption, eternal life).

## Salvation Invitation
- Pray to confess sin, trust Christ; yields to His lordship.
