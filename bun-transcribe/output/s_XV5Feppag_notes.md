# Galatians Book Study Introduction

## Speaker
- Pastor (unnamed in transcript; Gary Hamrick inferred from context)

## Overview
- New book study on Galatians, starting Chapter 1.
- Possibly Paul's first epistle (~49 AD), post-first missionary journey.
- Written to churches in Galatia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey): Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Derbe, Lystra.
- Corrective epistle addressing doctrinal drift due to Judaizers (Jews believing in Jesus + Mosaic Law: circumcision, feasts, kosher, Sabbath).

## Key Message
- Salvation by **grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone**.
- "Jesus plus anything ruins everything"; law exposes sin (like thermometer) but cannot save.
- Judaizers pervert gospel (Galatians 1:7); Paul curses false teachers twice (anathema, Galatians 1:8-9).
- Examples of Paul's corrections:
  - Corinth: Divisions, sexual sin, drunkenness (1 Corinthians 3:1).
  - Thessalonica: Idleness awaiting Christ's return (2 Thessalonians 3:10).
- Paul not man-pleaser but bondservant of Christ (Galatians 1:10).
- Gospel summary (Galatians 1:3-5): Sin problem; evil age; need rescue; Jesus gave Himself.

## Historical Impact
- Martin Luther's favorite ("my wife," "my little Katie"); freed him from works-based Catholicism, sparked 1517 Reformation.

## Illustrations
- **Statue of Freedom**: Captain refused to discard during storm; parallels rejecting freedom in Christ for legalism.
- **Personal story**: Pastor led 91-year-old Ruth (rehab roommate, ex-CIA) to Christ via sinner's prayer; highlights works vs. faith error.
- **False gospels via "angels"** (demonic): Mormonism (Moroni), Islam (Gabriel to Muhammad), Christian Science (Mary Baker Eddy via séances).

## Scripture Reading
