# Galatians Book Study Introduction

## Sermon Theme
- Only Jesus is good; He died for sinners (us).
- Core gospel: Salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.
- "Jesus plus anything ruins everything."

## Background on Galatians
- Likely Paul's first epistle (~49 AD, post-first missionary journey).
- Written to churches in Galatia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey): Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Derbe, Lystra (Acts).
- Paul planted churches; false teachers (Judaizers) soon infiltrated with bad doctrine.

## Issues in Galatia
- Judaizers: Jews believing in Jesus as Messiah but requiring Mosaic Law (circumcision, feasts, kosher, Sabbath) for salvation ("Jesus plus").
- Paul condemns them strongly (Galatians 1:8-9: "anathema/accursed" for perverting gospel).
- Human heart drifts from truth without staying in Scripture/Jesus.
- Examples of other corrective epistles:
  - Corinth: Divisions, sexual sin, lawsuits (carnal, not spiritual).
  - Thessalonica: Quit work awaiting Christ's return.

## Key Doctrinal Points
- Law exposes sin, shows need for Savior (like thermometer); cannot save.
- Justification by faith, not works.
- Grace: "God's Riches At Christ's Expense."
- Historical impact: Martin Luther's epiphany; called Galatians "my wife/my little Katie"; sparked Protestant Reformation (1517) against works-based salvation.

## Scripture Reading & Summary (Galatians 1:1-10)
- Paul's apostleship from Jesus/God, not men.
- Greeting: Grace/peace from Father/Christ, who gave Himself for our sins to deliver from evil age.
- Astonishment at turning to "different gospel" (not another); Judaizers trouble/confuse.
- Curse any (person/angel) preaching other gospel.
- Paul serves Christ, not men-pleaser.

## Illustrations
- **Statue of Freedom**: Captain refused to throw overboard in storm; parallels not discarding freedom in Christ for legalism.
- **Ruth's Story**: 91-year-old roommate (ex-CIA, good works via charities); thought good deeds suffice for heaven. Led to pray sinner's prayer, accepted Christ. Ties to works vs. faith.

## Warnings on False Gospels
- Reject angel-preached gospels (demonic): Mormonism (Moroni), Islam (Gabriel to Muhammad), Christian Science (Mary Baker Eddy/seances).
- Angels don't preach gospel (except Revelation 14 future).

## Gospel Summary (Galatians 1:3-5)
- Sin problem.
- Evil age.
- Need rescue.
- Jesus gave Himself; glory to God.

## Application & Prayer
