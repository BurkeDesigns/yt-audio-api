# 2 Kings 16-17 Bible Study Notes

## Context
- Wednesday night verse-by-verse study in 2 Kings (OT); Sunday returns to 2 Corinthians.
- Divided kingdom: North (Israel, capital Samaria); South (Judah, capital Jerusalem).

## 2 Kings 16: King Ahaz of Judah (South)
- Most wicked Judah king: Child sacrifice to Molech (2 Kings 16:3; cf. 2 Chron 28, plural "children").
- Attacked by Israel (Pekah) and Syria (Rezin); hires Assyria's Tiglath-Pileser III with temple gold/silver.
- Assyria conquers Damascus, kills Rezin (v.9); Pekah retreats.
- Ahaz visits Damascus, copies pagan altar; Uriah the priest builds it in Jerusalem temple.
- Ahaz dismantles temple items (v.17), alters layout in deference to Assyria (becomes vassal).
- Dies; succeeded by good son Hezekiah.

### Principles
- God inserts Messiah hope amid sin (Isaiah 7:14, prophesied to Ahaz).
- Beware leaders (e.g., Uriah) who obey man over God.

## 2 Kings 17: Fall of Northern Kingdom (Israel)
- Hoshea (son of Elah), last king (9 years), evil but less than predecessors.
- Vassal to Assyria's Shalmaneser V; conspires with Egypt's "So," stops tribute, imprisoned.
- Assyria besieges Samaria 3 years (~725-722 BC); conquers, exiles Israel to Halah, Habor, Gozan, Medes cities.
- Assyrian policy: Exile elites, repopulate with foreigners.

### Reasons for Judgment (725 Years of Sin, ~1450-722 BC)
- Idolatry: Feared other gods, high places, pillars, Asherah poles (sexual idols), incense on hills.
- Child sacrifice (Molech), witchcraft; ignored prophets' warnings.
- Stiff-necked rebellion; Jeroboam's golden calves endured.

### Aftermath
- Remnant: Priests/Levites and faithful from north migrate south early (not "lost tribes"; God knows/preserves them, e.g., Rev. 144,000).
- Foreigners in Samaria ignore God; lions attack → Assyria sends exiled priest to teach rituals.
- Syncretism: Fear Yahweh ritually + own gods (e.g., Succoth-benoth, Nergal); child sacrifice continues.

### Principles
- God patient in mercy (~725 years), just in judgment.
- Compromise cedes ground to enemy.
- God sovereign over Israel's land.
- Avoid ritualism; pursue surrendered relationship with Christ (not "appease the lion").
