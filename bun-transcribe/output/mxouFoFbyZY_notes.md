# Sermon: Watchmen (Ezekiel 33)

## Overview
- Speaker teaches Ezekiel 33, emphasizing God's appointment of Ezekiel as a spiritual watchman for Israel.
- Watchman role: stationed at high points (e.g., city gates, towers) to **watch** for threats and **warn** people via trumpet (ram's horn).
- Key principle: Watchman accountable for warning, not people's response; blood on hearer's head if ignored (Ezekiel 33:1-9).
- Shift in Ezekiel: Chapters 1-32 focus on judgment; 33+ emphasize hope and repentance.

## Ezekiel's Role
- Appointed spiritual watchman to warn Israel of judgment and separation from God unless they repent ("turn from wicked ways").
- Freeing truth: Responsible only for obedience to God's word, not outcomes.
- Israel portrayed as rebellious; God calls them Ezekiel's people to warn.

## Application to Christians
- All Christians called as watchmen in modern society: proclaim Jesus, be **salt** (flavor, preserve, sting) and **light** (expose darkness, guide).
- People watch Christians' lives/deeds, leading to praise of God.
- Balance **warning** (hell, judgment, sin's consequences) and **teaching** (grace, truth, maturity in Christ).
- Goal: Present people mature in Christ; obedient sharing frees from response accountability.
- Jonah example: Obeyed after reluctance, Nineveh repented; God used him despite attitude.

## God's Heart (Ezekiel 33:10-16)
- Israel laments transgressions; God responds: No pleasure in wicked's death, desires **repentance** ("turn") and life.
- Fairness: Righteous who rebel judged by final rebellion; wicked who repent forgiven completely—no sins remembered.
- Two attributes:
  - Desires all to repent (sins eradicated).
  - Patient, erases forgiven sins (not held against us).

## Closing
- Call to obedience as watchmen; repent if needed—God forgives fully.
- Prayer reinforces God's compassion, mercy, unfailing love; sins removed "as far as east from west."
