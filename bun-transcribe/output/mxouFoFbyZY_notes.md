# Sermon: Watchmen (Ezekiel 33)

## Overview
- Ezekiel: underrated major prophet (~2500 years ago); Ch. 1 supernatural/angelic; Ch. 1-32 judgment, Ch. 33+ hope.
- Speaker directed by God to teach Ch. 33 despite preference for Ch. 1.

## Watchman Role (Ezekiel 33:1-7)
- Physical: stationed high (city gate/2 Samuel; tower/2 Kings); watch for threats, sound trumpet (ram's horn) to warn.
- If warns & ignored: blood on hearer's head.
- If fails to warn: blood on watchman's hand.
- Ezekiel appointed spiritual watchman for rebellious Israel: warn of judgment/death unless repent; responsible only for obedience, not response.

## Personal Illustration
- Wife (Kayla) "people watcher"; couple now enjoys together; all observe others (e.g., awkward eye contact).

## Christian Application
- All Christians: watchmen as salt/light (Matthew 5:13-16).
  - Salt: flavors, preserves, stings.
  - Light: exposes darkness, guides; let good deeds shine to glorify Father.
- Warn (hell/sin) *and* teach grace (Colossians 1:28; balance like Jesus/John the Baptist/Paul).
- Goal: present mature in Christ; not responsible for response, only obedience (like Ezekiel).
- Example: Jonah obeyed reluctantly; Nineveh repented; God saves despite wickedness.

## God's Heart (Ezekiel 33:10-11,16)
- No pleasure in wicked's death; desires repentance/turn (Greek: metanoia).
- Forgives completely: sins forgotten/erased, even for worst offenders.
- Fairness: righteous who rebel judged by end; wicked who repent saved.

## Closing: God's Attributes
- Wants all to repent, sins eradicated (2 Peter 3:9).
- Compassionate, merciful, slow to anger, unfailing love; removes sins "east from west."

## Prayer Emphasis
- Obey as watchmen; God holds accountable only for obedience, not responses.
- Repent; sins blotted out.
