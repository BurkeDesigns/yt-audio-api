# Sermon: Generous Giving (2 Corinthians 8-9)
**Date:** Mother's Day  
**Speaker:** Pastor (unnamed)  
**Theme:** Paul urges Corinthian church (Gentile, founded by Paul) to fulfill pledge and aid destitute Jewish believers in Jerusalem amid 1st-century persecution/shunning. Giving is worship to the Lord through the church, not socialism or wealth redistribution for survival needs. Titus (and likely Luke) to deliver funds.  

## Bible Facts on Money/Stewardship
- ~2,350 verses on money (twice as many as faith + prayer combined).
- Jesus spoke more on money stewardship than heaven/hell combined (only kingdom of God more).
- 16/38 parables involve money/possessions.

## 5 Principles of Generous Giving
- **Spiritual discipline:** Like faith, speech, knowledge, diligence, love (2 Cor 8:7); reveals character/heart.
- **Act of grace, not law/commandment:** Test of sincere love (2 Cor 8:8; 9:5); tithing principle (10% to Lord) still applies, but grace exceeds law minimum via heart motivation.
- **Sowing/reaping:** Proportional return; give generously, God provides generously (2 Cor 9:6); not "give to get rich."
- **Heart attitude over amount:** Purposeful, cheerful (not grudging/necessity); God tests/weighs heart (2 Cor 9:7); keep money if ungrateful.
- **God notices, meets all needs:** Always sufficient/abundant for good works (2 Cor 9:8,10-11,15); enriches for liberality/thanksgiving.

## Church Giving Notes

- Closing: Thanks for provision; commit to stewardship/generosity; bless moms/comfort lonely.
