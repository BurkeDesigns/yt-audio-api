# Sermon: Generous Giving (2 Corinthians 8-9)

## Context
- Delivered on Mother's Day; church goes verse-by-verse through Bible.
- Paul urges Corinthian (Gentile) church to fulfill prior pledge and aid destitute Jewish believers in Jerusalem amid 1st-century persecution (pre-Nero era, ~56 AD).
- Macedonians gave beyond ability from poverty; Titus (and likely Luke) to deliver gifts.
- Not socialism/redistribution; aid for survival needs, given to Lord through church.
- Church facts: No in-service offering (online/checks/boxes used); Bible has ~2,350 verses on money (more than faith/prayer); Jesus emphasized stewardship.

## Key Principles
- **Spiritual discipline**: Like faith, speech, knowledge, diligence, love (2 Cor 8:7); reveals character/heart.
- **Act of grace, not law**: Not commandment; test of love (2 Cor 8:8); tithing principle applies, but grace exceeds minimum (2 Cor 9:5).
- **Sowing/reaping**: Proportional return; give generously, God provides generously (2 Cor 9:6); not "give to get rich."
- **Heart attitude primary**: Cheerful, not grudging/reluctant; God values heart over amount (2 Cor 9:7).
- **God notices/provides**: Ensures sufficiency/abundance for good works (2 Cor 9:8); no fear of lack (Phil 4:19).

## Prayers
- Opening: Thanks for day/Word; seek clarity/application.
- Closing: Thanks for blessings/stewardship; praise faithful givers; bless moms.
