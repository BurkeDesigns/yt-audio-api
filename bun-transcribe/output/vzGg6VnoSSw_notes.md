## Main Theme: 5th Reason to Rejoice

- Joy when our witness/testimony impacts the world.
- Church must be unified/humble (building on prior) to effectively witness in a lost world.

## Key Exhortations (Philippians 2:12-18)

- **Work out your salvation with fear and trembling** (v.12): Live out what God works in (v.13); display faith publicly, not privately; produce fruit (reverence God).
- **Do all things without complaining/disputing** (v.14): Avoid whining/arguing to maintain witness.
- **Be blameless/harmless children of God without fault** (v.15): Contrast crooked/perverse generation; live without accusation (not sinless, but honorable/pure).
- **Shine as lights (luminaries/stars) in the world** (v.15): Reflect Jesus in dark world; hold fast word of life.
- Paul's joy: Not run/labored in vain (v.16); even if poured out as drink offering (imminent death, v.17-18).

## Crooked and Perverse Generation (v.15)

- Every generation since Eden: Crooked (_skolios_, bent like scoliosis); perverse (_diastrepho_, off God's path).
- Modern examples: Pornography, sex trafficking, crimes against children, transgender issues, same-sex marriage, abortion.
- God as plumb line (objective moral standard; Amos illustration).
- Culture rejects God, adopts man-made standards; contrast U.S. founding (laws of nature/nature's God from Blackstone).
- Historical parallels: Moses (Deuteronomy 32:5), Paul (62 AD), today.
- Warning: Don't conform to world (Romans 12:2, Colossians 2:8); be transformed.
- Mission: Conform (world) vs. transform others via Christ.

## Closing

- Prayer for effective ambassadorship.
- Future hope: Crooked made straight at Christ's return.
