# Bible Study: 2 Kings 14-15 (NKJV)

## Overview
- God's patience and pursuit of Israel despite idolatry; pursues people with goodness and mercy.
- Divided kingdom: North (Israel, capital Samaria); South (Judah, capital Jerusalem).
- Bible alternates between northern and southern kings.

## Recap: Amaziah (Judah)
- Good king but not like David; allowed high places (idol worship).
- Defeated Edomites, then worshiped their gods (pride).
- Challenged Jehoash (Israel); defeated despite larger army—God humbled him.
- Assassinated after conspiracy; succeeded by son Azariah/Uzziah (16 years old).

## Jehoash (Israel)
- Defeated Amaziah; died naturally, succeeded by Jeroboam II.

## Jeroboam II (Israel)
- Reigned 41 years; evil, continued Jeroboam I's sins.
- Restored territory per Jonah's prophecy (from Hamath to Dead Sea).
- God spared Israel despite affliction, using wicked king for deliverance—shows God's compassion for salvation.

## Azariah/Uzziah (Judah)
- Reigned 52 years (2nd longest in Judah); good like Amaziah but high places remained.
- Pride: Entered temple to burn incense (priestly role, not his as king from Judah tribe).
- Struck with leprosy (isolated last 7 years); son Jotham ruled as regent.
- Prophets: Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, Zechariah.
- Earthquake (~760 BC) referenced in future prophecy.
- Lesson: Start well irrelevant; finish well matters.

## Northern Kings (Rapid Succession, All Evil)
- **Zechariah** (6 months): Assassinated publicly by Shallum; ends Jehu dynasty.
- **Shallum** (1 month): Assassinated by Menahem.
- **Menahem** (10 years): Brutal (ripped open pregnant women); paid Assyria's Pul/Tiglath-Pileser III ~$46M silver (taxed wealthy) to retreat.
- **Pekahiah** (2 years): Assassinated by Pekah.
- **Pekah** (20 years): Assyria took cities (Ijon, Abel Beth Maachah, etc., Naphtali); assassinated by Hoshea.

## Key Principles
- Humble yourself or God will humble you.
- Reap what you sow.
- Appeasing enemy leads to return/worse attack (spiritual warfare: resist devil).
- God uses imperfect leaders; desires salvation over condemnation.

## Prayer Points
- Finish well in faith.
- God's mercy pursues us.
