# Bible Study: 2 Kings 14-15

## Context

- Study from New King James Version.
- Divided kingdom post-Solomon: North (Israel, 10 tribes, capital Samaria); South (Judah, 2 tribes, capital Jerusalem).
- God patient with Israel's idolatry, pursues rescue/salvation (e.g., 2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 18:23).

## Recap: Amaziah (Judah)

- Good king but not like David; allowed high places (idol worship).
- Defeated Edomites, then worshiped their gods (2 Chronicles 25:14-15).
- Pride led to challenge vs. Jehoash (Israel); defeated, Jerusalem breached.
- Assassinated after conspiracy; son Azariah/Uzziah (16) succeeds.
- Principle: God humbles the proud.

## Jehoash & Jeroboam II (Israel)

- Jehoash defeated Amaziah; died naturally; son Jeroboam II succeeds.
- Jeroboam II: 41 years, evil (Jeroboam I's sins); restored territory per Jonah son of Amittai prophecy.
- God used wicked king to save afflicted Israel.

## Azariah/Uzziah (Judah)

- 52 years (2nd longest); good like Amaziah but high places remained.
- Struck with leprosy for pride: entered temple to burn incense (priestly role, 2 Chronicles 26:16-21).
- Isolated last 7 years; son Jotham co-ruled.
- Prophets: Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, Zechariah.
- Earthquake (~760 BC) referenced in Zechariah 14 (future link to Christ's return).
- Isaiah's vision (Isaiah 6) year of Uzziah's death.
- Principle: Finish well (not just start).

## Northern Kings Rapid Succession (Unraveling)

- Zechariah: 6 months, evil; assassinated publicly by Shallum (ends Jehu dynasty).
- Shallum: 1 month; assassinated by Menahem.
- Menahem: 10 years, evil; ripped open pregnant women; paid Tiglath-Pileser III (Pul) ~$46M silver (taxed wealthy) to retreat.
- Pekahiah: 2 years, evil; assassinated by Pekah.
- Pekah: 20 years, evil; Assyria took cities (Ijon, Abel Beth Maachah, etc., Naphtali); assassinated by Hoshea.
- Only 1/5 died naturally; foreshadows Assyrian conquest (723 BC).

## Principles

- Humble yourself or God will.
- Reap what you sow (Galatians 6:7-8; Hosea 8:7).
- Don't appease enemy (Assyria returns stronger); resist devil.
- God's heart: salvation, not condemnation.
