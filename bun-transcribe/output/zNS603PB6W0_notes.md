# Bible Study Notes: 1 Chronicles 16

## Historical Context
- David, 7 years into reign as king over all Israel, brings Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (city as capital).
- Ark: Sacred object representing God's presence between cherubim (temporary tent, not full tabernacle at Gibeon).
- Transport: Initially wrong (cart, death occurred); corrected (priests carry on poles).
- Michal despises David's undignified worship; result: no children (2 Samuel 6:23).

## Key Events (1 Chronicles 16:1-7)
- Ark placed in David's tent; burnt/peace offerings made.
- David blesses people, distributes food (bread, meat, raisin cake) to all Israel.
- Levites appointed to minister: Asaph (chief, wrote 12 Psalms), Zechariah, others; instruments (harps, cymbals, trumpets).
- David gives psalm to Asaph for ongoing worship (vv. 8-22 = Psalm 105:1-15).

## Worship Principles
- Only God worthy of worship (God-centric, not self-centric).
- 9 ways to worship (vv. 8-12): give thanks, call on name, make deeds known, sing psalms, talk of works, glory in name, rejoice/seek Lord, remember works/judgments.
- Worship beyond singing: living sacrificially (Romans 12:1).

## Everlasting Covenant (vv. 15-22)
- God's covenant with Abraham, oath to Isaac, confirmed to Jacob/Israel: land of Canaan as inheritance (everlasting).
- **Covenant Definition**: Solemn, God-initiated agreement (conditional or unconditional, sealed by oath/blood).

### Biblical Covenants Overview
| Covenant | Type | Promise | Sign |
|----------|------|---------|------|
| Adam | Conditional | Bless offspring, fruitful/multiply (no tree) | Marriage |
| Noah | Unconditional | No worldwide flood | Rainbow (7 colors) |
| Abraham | Unconditional | Land (Nile to Euphrates), great nation, bless descendants/world (Genesis 12:1-3; 15) | Blood rite (animals cut, God passes through) |
| Moses | Conditional | Be their God if obey/worship alone | Law (Ten Commandments) |
| David | Unconditional | (Chapter 17) | - |
| New (Jesus) | Conditional | Salvation via faith; Old/New Testaments | Communion, baptism |

- Abrahamic: Unconditional, for people (Jews from Abraham/Isaac/Jacob) and place (300k sq mi intended; Israel now 8.5k).
- Rejects "God done with Israel"; counters anti-Semitism; pray for Jerusalem's peace (Romans 11:25-26).
- Modern Israel imperfect but covenant endures; bless Israel (no land for peace).
