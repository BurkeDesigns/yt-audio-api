# Bible Study: 1 Chronicles 16

## Context and Recap
- David, king over unified Israel (7+ years), brings Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem in temporary tent (not full tabernacle, which remains in Gibeon - 1 Chron 16:39).
- Ark transport: Initially wrong (cart, death occurred); corrected (priests carry on poles).
- David's exuberant worship; Michal despises him (2 Sam 6:23 notes her childlessness).
- Principles from Ch 15: Worship God alone (God-centric, not self-centric).

## Key Events in Ch 16
- Ark placed; burnt/peace offerings; David blesses people, distributes food (bread, meat, raisin cake) to all Israel (men/women).
- Levites appointed to minister, thank, praise before Ark:
  - Chief: Asaph (wrote 12 Psalms; cymbals).
  - Others: Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom.
  - Instruments: Harps, lyres, trumpets (priests Jeiel, Jehaziel).
- David delivers psalm to Asaph (1 Chron 16:8-22 = Psalm 105:1-15).

## Ways to Worship (1 Chron 16:8-12)
- 9 directives: Give thanks; call on name; make known deeds; sing; talk of wondrous works; glory in holy name; rejoice (seekers); seek Lord/strength/face; remember marvelous works.
- Worship not limited to singing; includes lifestyle (Rom 12:1 - living sacrifice).

## God's Everlasting Covenant (1 Chron 16:15-22)
- With Abraham (oath to Isaac, confirmed to Jacob/Israel): Land of Canaan as inheritance (few strangers → everlasting).
- **Covenants overview**:
  | Covenant | Type | Promise | Sign |
  |----------|------|---------|------|
  | Adam | Conditional | Bless offspring (fruitful/multiply; no tree) | Marriage |
  | Noah | Unconditional | No global flood | Rainbow (7 colors) |
  | Abraham | Unconditional | Land (Nile-Euphrates), great nation, bless/curse others, all families blessed | Blood rite (Gen 15) |
  | Moses | Conditional | Be their God (worship alone) | Law (Ten Commandments) |
  | David | Unconditional | (Ch 17 preview) | - |
  | New (Jesus) | Conditional (faith) | Salvation/forgiveness | Communion, baptism |

## Abrahamic Covenant Emphasis
- Unconditional; everlasting; for people (descendants: Abraham-Isaac-Jacob-Jews) and place (300k sq mi vs. modern Israel's 8.5k).
- Fulfilled despite disobedience; counters anti-Semitism (God not done with Israel; Rom 11:26).
- Modern implications: Pray for Jerusalem peace; bless Israel (despite policy disagreements); giving land (e.g., Gaza 2005) fails against annihilation goals.
- Satan's attacks on Jews (Rev 12-13); Israel imperfect but covenant endures.

## Closing Prayer
- Thanks for covenants (Israel, Jesus); pray salvation (Jews, Muslims, atheists); safety.
