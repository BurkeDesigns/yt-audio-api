# Sermon Summary: 1 Chronicles 20-21

## Context from Prior Lesson

- Pastor Gary covered 1 Chronicles 20: Beware of ease/downtime when Satan works overtime.
- Parallels David's sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11).

## Philistine Giants Destroyed (1 Chronicles 20:4-8)

- Wars at Gezer, Philistine territory; giants (Rephaim descendants) defeated by David's mighty men, not David.
- **Giants and killers**:
  - Sippai (Sipai): Killed by Sibbechai (Sibekai) the Hushathite, commander of 24,000.
  - Lahmi: Brother of Goliath (Gittite); spear shaft like weaver's beam (~2.5" thick, 12+ ft long, 15 lb head); killed by Elhanan son of Jair (one of the 30 mighty men).
  - Unnamed giant at Gath: Great stature, 24 fingers/toes (6 per hand/foot); defied Israel; killed by Jonathan, son of Shimeah (David's brother).
- Parallels 2 Samuel 21:15-22 (includes Ishbi-benob, killed by Abishai saving David).
- Giants (Rephaim/Nephilim lineage): Post-flood race from angels mingling with humans (Genesis 6); fought by Abraham (Genesis 14), Moses (Og, Deuteronomy 3:11); anti-God, linked to occult/chaos.

## David's Census Sin (1 Chronicles 21:1-\*)

- Satan incites David to number fighting men (pride); parallels 2 Samuel 24 (God sovereignly allows due to anger with Israel).
- David orders Joab from Beersheba to Dan; Joab resists (risks guilt), omits Levi/Benjamin.
- Results: 1.1M Israel, 470K Judah (~1.57M total warriors; ~6M population est.).
- God displeased, strikes Israel; David confesses sin/iniquity (guilt), seeks removal.
- God offers 3 punishments via Gad (seer): 3 yrs famine, 3 mo. defeat by foes, 3 days plague.
- David chooses plague ("hand of the Lord" for mercy); 70K die; destroying angel halts at Ornan's (Arnan/Ornan) threshing floor (Mount Moriah).
- David/elders humble (sackcloth); David intercedes for people ("sheep").
- David buys floor from Ornan for 600 shekels gold (~1.2M USD today); offers sacrifices; angel sheathes sword.

## Key Lessons

- Sin causes distance/shame; confession brings healing, forgiveness, intimacy (to God: 1 John 1:9; to others: James 5:16).
- God righteous in justice (consequences) and mercy (relents plague).
- Jesus paid ultimate price as sacrifice on same site (Mount Moriah: Abraham/Isaac, future temple/cross).

## Prayer Close

- Thanks for timeless lessons; confess sin for restoration; praise God's justice/mercy/Jesus' sacrifice.
