## Recent Events (June 2025)

## Ezekiel 38 Coalition Against Israel
- **Leader**: Gog, prince/tsar of Magog/Rosh/Meshech/Tubal (ancient Scythians; modern Russia, incl. Moscow, Tobolsk).
- **Nations** (6 total, Islamic/African/European focus; pre-Armageddon campaign, possibly spanning Tribulation):
  - Persia: Iran.
  - Cush: Ethiopia (45% Sunni Muslim), incl. N. Sudan (70% Sunni).
  - Put: Libya (97% Sunni).
  - Gomer: Eastern Europe (Germany/Poland).
  - Togarmah: Turkey (possibly Armenia/Georgia).
- Israel dwells safely (unwalled villages) when attacked for plunder.
- Not Armageddon but leads to it.

## Questioning Nations (Ezekiel 38:13)
- Sheba/Dedan: Saudi Arabia (questions motives; possibly via Abraham Accords).
- Tarshish & "young lions": England (beyond Gibraltar); possibly veiled US reference (former colony; post-rapture weakened).
- Missing: Egypt/Jordan (peace treaties), Syria (Damascus ruined, Isaiah 17:1).

## God's Intervention
- Divine judgment: Fury, earthquake, mountains fall, infighting, pestilence, hail/fire (Ezekiel 38:18-23).
- Parallels Revelation 16 (Armageddon): Earthquake, mountains/islands flee, hail (100 lbs), wrath.
- Kings of East (China, etc.) join; Christ returns (Revelation 19:11-16) as King of Kings.

## Conclusion
- Anti-Semitism/demonic rise fuels war; God defends Israel (Psalm 121:4).
- Hope: Rapture before/during; look up (Luke 21:28).
