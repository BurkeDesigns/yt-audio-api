# Sermon: Ezekiel 38 and End Times Prophecy

## Speaker
- Pastor (unnamed, Cornerstone Chapel)

## Purpose
- Frame world events through Bible lens; prepare, not scare, via prophecy.
- Reference to Martin Luther: Preach gospel addressing current issues.

## Current Events (June 2025)
- June 21: US strikes 3 Iranian nuclear sites (Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan) after Israel bombs Iran; temporary setback, not world peace.
- June 22: Russia (Dmitry Medvedev) claims multiple countries ready to supply Iran nukes; Russia offers mediation, backs Iran historically.
- Russia-Iran partnership: 20-year treaty (Jan 2025), arms deals, S-300 systems; unintended consequence of US/Israel actions pushes them closer.
- 2019 Netanyahu warning on Iran-Russia ties.

## Ezekiel 38 Overview
- Pre-Armageddon coalition (may span 7-year Tribulation) against Israel dwelling safely.
- Led by **Gog** (prince/tsar of **Russia**): Land of Magog (Scythians, N of Black/Caspian Seas); Rosh (Russia); Meshech (Moscow); Tubal (Tobolsk).

### Coalition Nations (6 total)
- **Persia**: Iran (rearms post-strikes).
- **Cush**: Ethiopia (45% Sunni Muslim), incl. N Sudan (70% Sunni).
- **Put**: Libya (97% Sunni Muslim).
- **Gomer**: Eastern Europe (Germany/Poland).
- **House of Togarmah**: Turkey (possibly Armenia/Georgia).
- Attack for plunder; Islamic states of upper Nile + others.

### Questioning Nations (v13)
- **Sheba/Dedan**: Saudi Arabia (possible Abraham Accords motive).
- **Tarshish & young lions**: England (lion symbol); possibly US (former colony, post-Rapture weakened by missing Christians).

### Missing Nations
- Egypt, Jordan (peace treaties); Syria (Isaiah 17:1 - Damascus ruined).

## God's Intervention (Ezekiel 38:18-23)
- Earthquake, mountains fall, infighting, pestilence, bloodshed, hail, fire, brimstone.
- God magnifies Himself; nations know He is Lord (Psalm 121:4).

## Links to Armageddon
- Parallels Revelation 16: Earthquake, hail (100lb stones), mountains/islands flee, wrath.
- Kings of East (China, etc.) join.
- Culminates Revelation 19:11-16 - Christ returns on white horse as King of Kings, saints follow.

## Conclusion
- Temporary Mideast peace; watch for Russia-Iran rearmament.
- Luke 21:28: Look up, redemption near; rapture before/during Ezekiel 38.
