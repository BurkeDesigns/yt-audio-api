# Ephesians 3:14-21 Bible Study Summary

## Context
- Pastor teaches straight through Ephesians at Cornerstone Chapel.
- Paul planted Ephesus church (Acts 19-20: 3 years ministry, revival, riot).
- Wrote Ephesians ~5 years later from Roman prison under Nero's persecution.
- Encourages perseverance in hostile culture; prays twice (ch. 1:15-19: know God better; ch. 3: second prayer).

## Paul's Prayer Posture (v. 14)
- Kneels before Father of Lord Jesus Christ.
- Biblical examples: kneeling (1 Kings 8:54; Ezra 9:5; Daniel 6:10; Acts 9:40); standing (1 Samuel 1:9; 2 Chronicles 20:13; Job 30:20; Mark 11:25).
- No single posture required; focus on prayer; kneeling shows seriousness, love, reverence.

## Four Prayer Requests
- **Strengthened spiritually (v. 16)**: Inner man/soul via Spirit; counters weariness (e.g., Paul in 2 Corinthians 1:8; Elijah in 1 Kings 19:4; Jonah 4:3; Psalm 42; Luther, Spurgeon).
- **Christ dwell in hearts through faith (v. 17)**: "Dwell" (katoikeo) means "at home/completely comfortable"; Jesus comfortable with media, phone, places, conversations.
- **Comprehend God's love experientially (vv. 17-19)**: Rooted/grounded in love; width/length/depth/height; surpasses knowledge (e.g., Karl Barth: "Jesus loves me"); sacrificial (Ephesians 5:2), demonstrable (Romans 5:8), generous (1 John 3:1), unconditional (character-based).
- **Filled with fullness of God (v. 19)**: More Christ, less self (John 3:30); empty me, fill with You.

## Benediction (vv. 20-21)
- God does exceedingly abundantly above all we ask/think via His power.

## Closing Prayer
- Pastor prays the four requests for congregation.
