# Bible Study: Ephesians 3:14-21

## Speaker
- Pastor at Cornerstone Chapel

## Context and Background
- Series: Verse-by-verse through Bible; now in Ephesians 3 (New Testament, NKJV).
- Paul's history: Spent 3 years in Ephesus (Acts 19-20), planted church amid revival and riot; wrote Ephesians ~5 years later from Roman prison under Nero's persecution.
- Purpose: Encourage believers to persevere in faith amid hostility (timeless for today).
- Prayers in Ephesians:
  - Ch. 1:15-19: Know God better, grow deeper.
  - Ch. 3:14-21: Second prayer (4 requests, each starting with "that").

## Prayer Posture
- Paul kneels (v. 14) to show seriousness, love, reverence.
- Biblical examples of kneeling: 1 Kings 8:54 (Solomon), Ezra 9:5, Daniel 6:10, Acts 9:40 (Peter).
- Other postures valid: Standing (1 Samuel 1:9 [Hannah], 2 Chronicles 20:13, Job 30:20, Mark 11:25 [Jesus]); sitting, prostrate, eyes open/closed.
- Poem shared: No single "proper" posture; key is praying earnestly, esp. for others.

## Paul's 4 Prayer Requests
- **1. Spiritual strength (v. 16)**: God grant strength via Spirit in inner man/soul ("riches of his glory"); counters weariness (examples: Paul in 2 Corinthians 1:8, Elijah in 1 Kings 19:4, Jonah 4:3, Psalm 42 ["downcast soul"], Luther/Spurgeon).
- **2. Christ dwell in hearts (v. 17a)**: Thoroughly/at home (Greek: *kataoikeo*) through faith; Jesus comfortable with TV/Netflix, phone, hangouts, conversations (anecdote: NFL friend at home).
- **3. Comprehend God's love (vv. 17b-19)**: Experientially know Christ's vast love (width/length/depth/height, surpasses knowledge); not intellectual; sacrificial (Ephesians 5:2), demonstrable (Romans 5:8), generous (1 John 3:1), unconditional (character-based, not earned); Karl Barth story: "Jesus loves me."
- **4. Filled with God's fullness (v. 19)**: Empty self, more Jesus (John 3:30); song: "Empty Me" (Jeremy Camp).

## Closing
- Benediction (vv. 20-21): God does "exceedingly abundantly" via His power.
- Pastoral prayer: Repeated 4 requests for congregation.

## Announcements
- None made.
