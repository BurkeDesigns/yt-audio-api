## Sunrise Easter Service Notes

### Service Overview
- Outdoor sunrise service in new Cornerstone Chapel courtyard (first use; already outgrown).
- Greeting emphasizes joy of resurrection; references Proverbs 27:14 on early morning greetings.
- Led by unnamed pastor; younger worship team.
- Theme: Encouragement for believers on Jesus' resurrection (not evangelism-focused).

### Worship
- Songs: "Because He Lives", "In Christ Alone" (Praise the Father, Praise the Son), "O Praise the Name".
- Opening and closing prayers praising resurrection, creation, and hope in Christ.

### Sermon: John 20:1-18
- Narrative summary: Mary Magdalene finds empty tomb early morning; alerts Peter and John (John outruns Peter); they see linen cloths but leave; Mary weeps, encounters angels and unrecognized Jesus (mistaken for gardener); recognizes Him when He says "Mary"; instructed to tell disciples of ascension.
- **Three Key Points on Resurrection**:
  - **Factual**: Historical evidence (Simon Greenleaf quote); skeptics converted (Lew Wallace/Ben-Hur, Frank Morrison/Who Moved the Stone?, Josh McDowell/Evidence That Demands a Verdict, Lee Strobel/The Case for Christ, Robert Ingersoll's friend); martyrs died defending it.
  - **Powerful**: Proves authority/legitimacy; Jesus predicted it (10x in Gospels); unique to Christianity (other leaders' tombs intact); Jesus superior as living Lord.
  - **Personal**: Knows us by name (Mary example); reasons for non-recognition (context, shock, preconceptions); McDonald's milkshake analogy illustrates preconceptions; new name in heaven; offers living hope and eternal inheritance (1 Peter 1:3-4).
- Closing: Hope amid despair (e.g., Brad Delp suicide); prayer for world to know resurrection truth.
