## Sermon: Three Reminders on Jesus' Resurrection
### 1. Factual
- Historical evidence stronger than most events (Simon Greenleaf, Harvard Law).
- Skeptics converted: Lew Wallace (*Ben-Hur*), Frank Morrison (*Who Moved the Stone?*), Josh McDowell (*Evidence That Demands a Verdict*), Lee Strobel (*The Case for Christ*), Robert Ingersoll influenced friend.
- Apostles/martyrs died defending it; no one dies for a known lie.

### 2. Powerful
- Proves authority/credibility; Jesus predicted it 10+ times (e.g., Mark 9:31).
- Paul in Acts 13:28- (preached resurrection post-crucifixion).
- Unique vs. other leaders (Confucius, Buddha, Muhammad buried); distinguishes Christianity.

### 3. Personal
- Jesus knows us by name (John 20 example: calls "Mary"; she mistakes Him for gardener due to context/shock/preconception).
- Story: Speaker's McDonald's mix-up (pumpkin vs. chocolate shake) illustrates preconceptions.
- New name in heaven (Revelation 2:17); personal God (Romans 5:8).
- Benefits (1 Peter 1:3-4): living hope, eternal inheritance (forgiveness, heaven).

## Closing
- Hope for hopeless (e.g., Brad Delp suicide note); overflow with hope (Romans 15:13).
- More services today; greet others.
