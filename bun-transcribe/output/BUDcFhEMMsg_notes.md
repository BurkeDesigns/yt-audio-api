# Mystery of Lawlessness (2 Thessalonians 2) - Part 2

## Overview
- Follow-up to prior rapture teaching; focuses on time of lawlessness/Antichrist before Day of the Lord (Tribulation).
- Paul wrote 2 Thess ~50 AD; mystery of lawlessness already at work secretly (Greek: *anomia* = contempt for God's laws/wickedness).
- "Mystery" (Greek: *musterion*) = hidden truth revealed in NT (e.g., rapture not in OT).

## End Times Timeline
- Church age (now; post-Pentecost, time of Gentiles).
- Pre-trib rapture (Rev 3); possible gap before Tribulation.
- Daniel's 70th week (7 years):
  - First 3.5 years: False peace; Antichrist covenant (likely Israel peace treaty/temple); mark of beast; two witnesses.
  - Midpoint: Antichrist breaks covenant, abomination of desolation, claims deity in temple; one-world religion/currency.
  - Last 3.5 years (Great Tribulation/Time of Jacob's Trouble): Worst evil.
- Christ returns, destroys Antichrist, establishes kingdom.

## Preconditions for Day of the Lord (in order)
- **Rebellion/Apostasy** (2 Thess 2:3; Greek: *apostasia*): Great falling away from God/Bible/faith; linked to last-days doctrines of demons (1 Tim 4:1); before/after rapture but pre-Antichrist.
- **Restrainer Removed** (2 Thess 2:6-7): Holy Spirit steps aside (not removed; still enables salvation in Tribulation); currently restrains pure evil (John 16:8).
- **Antichrist Revealed**: Man of lawlessness/son of perdition/beast; subtle rise (e.g., Daniel's "little horn").

## Antichrist Profile
- **Titles**: Man of sin/lawlessness (2 Thess 2:3); son of perdition (only Judas/Antichrist); beast (Rev 13); little horn (Dan 7:8); willful king (Dan 11:36).
- **Partner**: False prophet (beast from earth; religious power).
- **Traits**:
  - Exalts self as God in temple; opposes all worship/God.
  - Satan-empowered: Power, signs, lying wonders, deception (2 Thess 2:9).
  - Charismatic political leader; subtle/voted into power; possibly Jewish/Gentile debate.
  - Defeats two witnesses temporarily; world worships ("who can make war with beast?").
- **Types in Bible**: Nimrod, Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Haman, Goliath, Judas (Satan-possessed).
- **Destiny**: Destroyed by Christ's breath/word/coming (2 Thess 2:8; Rev lake of fire).
- Speculation (stage-setting): AI/mark, temple location (Temple Mount/City of David/tabernacle), current figures.

## Conclusion & Exhortation
- Stand firm; grip teachings (2 Thess 2:15-17, NLT): Hold truth, eternal comfort/hope.
- God patient for repentance (2 Pet 3); equip to evangelize; focus on Jesus, not Antichrist.
