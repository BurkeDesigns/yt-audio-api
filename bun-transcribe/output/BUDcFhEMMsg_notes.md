# Sermon Notes: Mystery of Lawlessness (2 Thessalonians 2) – Part 2

## Context
- Follow-up to prior teaching on rapture (available on website/YouTube).
- Focus: End-times events before Day of the Lord/Tribulation, including Antichrist.
- Pre-trib rapture view emphasized; church age ongoing, followed by potential gap, then 7-year Tribulation (Daniel's 70th week).

## End-Times Timeline
- **69 weeks** (Daniel 9:24-27): From Jerusalem rebuild (Artaxerxes/Nehemiah) to Jesus' crucifixion (~33 AD).
- **Gap (Church Age/Time of Gentiles)**: Current era; God's patience for salvation.
- **Rapture**: Pre-trib (Rev 3); removes church.
- **Tribulation (7 years)**:
  - First 3.5 years: False peace; Antichrist covenant (possibly temple-related); mark of beast; two witnesses.
  - Midpoint: Antichrist breaks covenant, declares self God in temple (abomination of desolation); Great Tribulation begins.
  - Last 3.5 years: Worst period (Jacob's trouble).
- Christ's return: Destroys Antichrist, establishes kingdom.

## Key Events Before Tribulation (2 Thess 2)
1. **Rebellion/Falling Away (Apostasia)**:
   - Great apostasy: Abandonment of true God/Bible/faith (only NT use of term).
   - Opposite of revival; links to last days' doctrines of demons (1 Tim 4:1).
   - Timing: Before/around rapture, before Antichrist revealed.

2. **Restrainer Removed**:
   - "He" (Holy Spirit) steps aside (not removed); currently restrains pure evil/lawlessness.
   - Holy Spirit remains active (salvations in Tribulation); convicts world (John 16:8).

3. **Revealing of Antichrist (Man of Lawlessness)**:
   - Mystery of lawlessness (anomia: contempt for God's laws) active since Paul's time.
   - Titles: Man of sin, son of perdition (doomed to destruction; shared with Judas), beast (Rev), little horn (Dan 7:8), willful king (Dan 11:36).
   - Rise: Subtle, political, charismatic; empowered by Satan (power, signs, wonders, deception).
   - Traits: Opposes/exalts self above God; sits in temple claiming deity; false peace covenant; one-world religion/currency; mark of beast.
   - Partner: False prophet (beast from earth).
   - Types in Bible: Nimrod, Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Haman, Goliath, Judas.
   - Destiny: Destroyed by Christ's breath/word at Second Coming.
   - Speculation: Jewish/Gentile?; alive now?; AI links?; not female/Trump/etc.

## Application & Conclusion
- Stand firm; grip teachings/Bible tightly (2 Thess 2:15).
- God provides comfort/hope; patient for repentance (2 Pet 3 implied).
- Focus: Jesus' return, evangelism; Holy Spirit active.

## Announcements
- None.
