# Cornerstone Connection Interview: Gary Hamrick with Patty Height

## Guest Background
- Patty Height leads **Out of Egypt Ministries** (outofegyptministries.org).
- Born 1966, grew up in Jamestown, NY; youngest sibling (15-13 years younger), felt like an only child due to family dynamics.
- Parents married 67 years but home had unhealthy situations: lack of nurturing touch from mother, inappropriate touch/abuse, verbal belittling.

## Early Struggles
- Self-harm from age 5: picking skin, cutting, pouring water/alcohol on wounds to mask emotional pain.
- Gender confusion from early childhood: identified as boy, sought sleepovers with boys; doctor at age 8 dismissed it.
- Puberty: stuffed socks in underwear for male sensation; fantasized about male anatomy but knew surgery wouldn't satisfy.
- Teen years: lonely, no friends, sold drugs, played adult softball, partied with older crowds.

## Same-Sex Attraction and Relationships
- Instinctively knew same-sex attraction was wrong; suppressed it.
- Left home at 17 for Florida; dated abusive ex-convict man for attention, married ~1 year later.
- Experienced verbal/sexual/physical abuse from men; concluded "all men are bad," dressed masculinely (men's clothes/cologne) for protection.
- Post-divorce: dated women; entered long-term lesbian relationship (both flight attendants; impacted by 9/11, brother's cancer death).

## Conversion (January 19, 2003)
- Brother shared gospel before dying; saw joy in him.
- Asked partner if lifestyle was wrong; mutual conviction led both to salvation at Calvary Chapel Old Bridge (Pastor Lloyd Pulley).
- Walked in as lovers, left as sisters in Christ; ended romantic/emotional dependence over time.
- Church welcomed without judgment; Pastor Pulley urged patience for Holy Spirit's work.

## Key Insights
- Root of struggles: rejection (real/perceived), counterfeited by Satan (vs. Christ as cornerstone).
- Gender dysphoria/SAME: exhausting, no rest; freedom in Christ surpasses all.
- No longer has same-sex attraction or gender confusion; transformation was process starting with anger.

## Advice
- **To families**: Include LGBTQ+ loved ones/partners (e.g., dinners, games); show Christ's joy/love without condoning sin. Offer hotel help if needed; state beliefs upfront.
- **To strugglers**: Jesus loves/sees you; lay down sins for better life; trust Him—He addresses heart issues in His order.
