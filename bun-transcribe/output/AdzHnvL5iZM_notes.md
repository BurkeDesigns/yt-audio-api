# Speakers

# Interview Overview
- Unscripted discussion on Patty Height's testimony: from childhood trauma, self-harm, gender confusion, same-sex attraction, to transformation through Christ.
- Focus: Root causes (rejection/lack of love), same-sex relationships, gender dysphoria, redemption, advice for families and strugglers.

# Patty's Background and Trauma
- Grew up in Jamestown, NY; youngest child (15-13 years younger than siblings); unhealthy home despite parents' 67-year marriage.
- Lacked nurturing touch; experienced inappropriate touch and sexual abuse; self-harm from age 5 (picking skin, knives, alcohol on wounds) to mask emotional pain.
- Gender confusion from early age: identified as boy; mother sought doctor advice at age 8 (told to wait for puberty).
- Isolated: Felt like only child; siblings left home early; fantasized about "real parents"; post-puberty, stuffed socks in underwear for male sensation.

# Teenage and Young Adult Years
- No friends; kicked off school softball team after drug sales; played adult leagues/parties (age 14-16).
- Moved to Florida at 17; dated then married ex-prisoner man for acceptance (not attraction); endured verbal/physical/sexual abuse.
- Developed hatred of men; dressed fully in men's clothing (underwear, cologne) for protection/control.
- Entered same-sex relationships; knew instinctively wrong but pursued due to longing for love.

# Root Causes
- Common thread: Rejection (real/perceived from abuse, death, etc.) as "counterfeit cornerstone" (vs. Christ in 1 Peter 2).
- Exhausting dysphoria: Constant fear of not "passing" as desired gender.

# Conversion and Transformation
- Triggers: 9/11 (flight attendant), brother's lung cancer/death (shared gospel via neighbor).
- Confronted girlfriend: Both questioned lifestyle; saved same day (Jan 19, 2003) at Calvary Chapel Old Bridge, NJ (Pastor Lloyd Pulley).
- Walked in as lovers, out as sisters; ended romantic/emotional dependency later for full obedience.
- Now: No same-sex attraction or gender confusion; full freedom in Christ; ex-partner is missionary.

# Church Experience
- Welcomed normally at Calvary Chapel; saw "glow" like brother's; Pastor Lloyd urged patience for Holy Spirit's work.

# Advice
- **To parents of those in SSA/relationships**: Include partners lovingly (dinners, games); show Christ's joy/home; offer hotel help; state beliefs upfront without rejection.
- **To strugglers**: Jesus loves/sees you; not mad/disappointed; lay down sins (like all believers); trust Him—He addresses heart issues first (e.g., Patty's anger).
