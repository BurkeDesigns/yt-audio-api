## Sermon: A Tale of Two Gardens (Pastor)
- **Garden of Eden (Genesis 2)**: God-planted, lush; Adam/Eve given choice (tree of knowledge); Satan tempts Eve, Adam fails; sin enters, expulsion, inherited sin nature.
- **Garden Tomb (John 19-20)**: Near Golgotha/Calvary; Jesus crucified, buried, rises; Mary Magdalene, Peter, John witness empty tomb/angels/Jesus.
- **Historical evidence**: Josephus (1st century): Jesus as Messiah, crucified, appeared alive 3rd day.
- **Contrasts**:
  | First Garden (Eden) | Second Garden (Tomb) |
  |---------------------|----------------------|
  | Sin entered | Sin forgiven |
  | Death reigned | Death conquered |
  | Separated from God | Reconciled to God |
  | Angels block entry | Angels reveal empty tomb |
  | Thorns curse (toil) | Jesus wears crown of thorns |
- Salvation: Admit sin, need Savior, accept Jesus (faith alone); public response honors Christ's public death.
- Funny story: Elderly man outwits rude driver at McDonald's (analogy: God outwits sin/death).

## Altar Call & Response

- Group sinner's prayer: Confess sin, accept Jesus as Lord/Savior.
