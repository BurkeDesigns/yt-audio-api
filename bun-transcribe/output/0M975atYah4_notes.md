## Sermon: A Tale of Two Gardens
- **Garden of Eden (Gen 2-3)**: God-planted paradise; Adam/Eve given choice (tree of knowledge); Satan tempts Eve (shiny serpent); sin enters, ruins perfection, curses with thorns/toil/death; inherited sin nature affects all (Rom 5:12; Ps 51:5)
- **Garden Tomb (John 19-20)**: Near Golgotha; Jesus crucified, buried in new tomb; Mary Magdalene finds empty tomb, sees angels/Jesus; contrasts Eden—sin forgiven, death conquered, reconciliation, angels invite entry
- Jesus wears thorns (curse for us); historical evidence (Josephus, eyewitnesses)
- Salvation: Admit sin, need Savior, accept Jesus (not religion, but relationship); public altar call for commitment

## Altar Call & Response
- Invitation to receive Christ (forgiveness, heaven); many respond publicly (front, overflows)
- Group sinner's prayer led by pastor
- Bibles distributed (children's/adult; online via text)
- Angels rejoice; baptisms Wed (not required for salvation)
