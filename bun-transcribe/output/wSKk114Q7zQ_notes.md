### Resources

- Free items: "Replacement Theology: What It Is & Why It Matters"; "Anti-Semitism: What Every Christian Needs to Know & How to Counter It" (Dr. Susan Michael/Karen Engel).

### Definitions
- **Anti-Semitism**: Hatred of Jews (Semites); includes anti-Zionism, blaming Jews for world problems, denying homeland right.
- **Zionism**: Biblical return of Jews to Zion (Jerusalem/Israel); part of God's salvation plan (Ezek 36-39 dry bones).

### Biblical Perspective on Israel
- Satan persecutes Jews/Israel (Rev 12:13; "woman"=Israel, "child"=Messiah).
- Abrahamic covenant unconditional (Gen 12:1-3: bless those who bless, curse cursers); applies to modern Israel.
- Rejects replacement theology: God not done with ethnic Israel (Rom 9-11; Rom 11:25-26 "all Israel saved"; Zech 13).
- Jews chosen not for superiority but to bring Word/Messiah; church rooted in Judaism.
- Salvation by faith in Yeshua for all; no free pass by ethnicity.

### Critics' Clips (Owens/Carlson)
- Owens: Zionism "grief" to US; Israel "demonic"; Netanyahu demon; conspiracy theories (Jews control/slave trade/9-11).
- Carlson: No "chosen people" (church only); US leaders betray America prioritizing Israel; Netanyahu "evil".
- Response: Demonic delusion; exposes via Eph 5:11; pray for discernment (2 Tim 2:23-26).

### October 7th & War
- 1,216 Israelis murdered (equiv. 60k US deaths proportionally); Hamas atrocities (babies microwaved, rapes, beheadings).
- Gaza received $ since 2005; built tunnels/rockets (tens of thousands fired) not state.
- War could end if Hamas stops/released hostages; 26k missiles on Israel since Oct 7.
- Israel response proportional; protects civilians.

### US-Israel Alliance
- Strategic: ME fortress vs. Iran; intel (Mossad); combat-ready forces; shared values/democracy (PragerU: 5 reasons).
- Spiritual battle: Anti-Israel = anti-US/Christianity; Jews (15M global, 7M Israel) blessed world (Nobel, inventions).
- Iran intel: 25k killed resisting regime.

### Closing
- Quotes Nie Moller poem on speaking out (Jews last before "me").
- Sammy Smaja prayer (Hebrew/English) for Israel, leaders, soldiers, attendees.
