# Rise of Anti-Semitism: Biblical Perspective on Israel and Jewish People

## Speakers
- Pastor Gary Hamrick (host, Cornerstone Chapel)
- Rob McCoy (pastor, Godspeak Calvary Chapel; former mayor)
- Sammy Smaja (TBN regional director Israel/Middle East; messianic pastor Jerusalem)
- Bob McEwen (former U.S. Congressman; Council on National Policy executive director)

## Introduction
- Anti-Semitism rising: ADL reports 344% increase in incidents over 5 years, 893% over decade (excludes policy opposition).
- Distinguishes policy criticism from anti-Semitism (harming/blaming Jews is demonic; Satan as accuser, Revelation 12).
- Catholic/Orthodox leaders condemned Christian Zionism (Jan 17 statement).
- Concerns over Candace Owens/Tucker Carlson comments dividing conservatives/Christians.
- Call for respect; pray for influencers; expose darkness biblically (Ephesians 5:11; 2 Timothy 2:23-26).

## Guest Clarifications
- Rob McCoy addressed accusation of shielding pedophile (Tom Semino): Attender served time, discipled, no recidivism, not near children; attack by Soros-linked group.

## Definitions
- **Anti-Semitism**: Hatred/opposition to Jews (includes anti-Zionism; blaming Jews for world problems).
- **Zionism**: Biblical return of Jews to homeland (Zion = Jerusalem/Israel); part of God's salvation plan.

## Biblical Case for Israel
- God chose Jews to bring Word, Messiah (not superior ethnicity); roots of Christianity in Judaism.
- Against replacement theology: God faithful despite apostasy (Ezekiel 36-39 dry bones; Romans 9-11).
- Genesis 12:1-3 unconditional covenant: Bless Israel, be blessed; curse Israel, be cursed (applies today).
- Church not replacement: "All Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:25-26); Jews need Yeshua, but God not done.
- Dead Sea Scrolls (1947) as "title deed" before Israel's rebirth.

## Critiques of Anti-Israel Views (Clips)
- Candace Owens: Zionism "grief"; Israel "demonic"; Netanyahu "demon"; conspiracy theories (e.g., Jews control everything, ancient tech).
- Tucker Carlson: No chosen people; church universal; Netanyahu "evil"; U.S. leaders betray America.
- Charlie Kirk rejected anti-Semitic scapegoating (Jews blamed for all ills).

## U.S.-Israel Alliance
- Strategic: Israel's location, military/intel (Mossad), Iran containment (PragerU: 5 reasons).
- Proportional response to Oct 7 (1,216 killed = 60K U.S. equivalent); Hamas atrocities, ongoing rockets (tens of thousands since 2005).
- Spiritual battle: Anti-Israel = anti-American/Christian; hate from Satan.
- Jewish global population: ~15M (0.2%); most targeted minority.

## Broader Context
- Oct 7 changed Israel/Middle East; Hamas invested aid in tunnels/weapons.
- Defend Jews as Christians would want defense (imagine anti-Christian attacks).
- Quotes: Bill Maher/Van Jones on tiny Jewish population deserving protection post-Holocaust.

## Closing
- Martin Niemöller poem: Speak out before "they come for you."
- God's favor remains on Israel/Jews; pray protection/blessing.
- Sammy Smaja closing prayer (Hebrew/English for Israel, attendees).
