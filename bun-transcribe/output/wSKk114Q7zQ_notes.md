# Church Service: Rise of Anti-Semitism in Church and Conservative Circles

## Opening Prayer and Welcome
- Pastor emphasizes God's ongoing favor for Israel/Jewish people; prays for protection, blessing, and biblical perspective in America.
- Welcomes in-person and online audience; requests respectful behavior on sensitive topic.

## Anti-Semitism Trends
- ADL reports: 344% increase in incidents over 5 years, 893% over decade (excludes policy opposition).
- Anti-Semitism defined as harming/blaming Jews delusionally/demonically; Satan as accuser (Rev 12:10; John 8:44; Rev 12:13 references Satan persecuting Israel).
- Recent: Catholic/Orthodox leaders in Holy Land condemn Christian Zionism as "damaging theology."

## Criticisms of Influencers
- Targets Candace Owens/Tucker Carlson for divisive comments on Israel/Jews, influencing millions.
- Owens mocks service, misnames church; clips show her calling Israel/Zionism "demonic," Netanyahu "demon," rejecting support.
- Carlson: No "chosen people" post-Jesus; mocks support for Israel as heresy/DNA favoritism.
- Pastor: Expose darkness biblically (Eph 5:11; 2 Tim 2:23-26); prays for influencers.

## Guest Introductions
- **Rob McCoy**: Pastor (30+ yrs, Godspeak Calvary Chapel); officiated Charlie Kirk's wedding; defied CA COVID mandates as mayor.
- **Sammy Smaja**: TBN Israel/ME director; SARL Tours president; pastors largest Hebrew-speaking Messianic congregation in Jerusalem.
- **Bob McEwen**: Former 6-term US Congressman (OH); Council for National Policy executive director; American history expert.

## Key Discussion Points
### Addressing Allegations (Rob McCoy)
- Defends church attendee Tom Semino (Megan's Law registrant): Disclosed past, no child contact/recidivism; discipled, family man; attacked by Soros-linked group.

### Definitions
- **Anti-Semitism**: Hatred/opposition to Jews (ethnic/spiritual); anti-Zionism often same (doubting Jewish right to homeland).
- **Zionism**: Biblical return of Jews to Zion (Jerusalem/Israel); fulfills prophecy for salvation/temple/Messiah.

### Biblical Defense of Israel
- God's promises unconditional (Gen 12:1-3: Bless those who bless Abraham's nation/seed).
- Rejects replacement theology: Church not replacing Israel; God faithful despite apostasy (Ezek 36-39 dry bones; Rom 9-11; Rom 11:25-26 "all Israel saved"; Zech 13).
- Jews gave world: Scriptures, Messiah (Jesus/Yeshua Jewish); Dead Sea Scrolls as "title deed."
- Salvation by grace/faith, not ethnicity/DNA; Jews need Yeshua like all.

### US Support for Israel
- Strategic: Fortress vs. Iran; intel (Mossad); combat experience; oil/geopolitics (PragerU clip).
- Proportional response to Oct 7 (1,216 killed = 60K US equivalent); Hamas atrocities, rockets since 2005 Gaza handover.
- Spiritual battle: Haters of Israel hate Christ/America (Esther/Haman; BLM anti-Jesus graffiti).
- Jewish global pop: ~15M (0.2%); most targeted minority.

### Oct 7 War Response
- Hamas: Murdered/raped/kidnapped; built tunnels/weapons vs. state-building.
- Israel: Offered ceasefires; 26K missiles fired at Israel post-Oct 7.
- Critics (Owens/Carlson): Israel overboard, Netanyahu evil; ignores Hamas continuation.

### Closing Clips/Remarks
- Moderate Case Guy: Defend Jews as Christians would want defense.
- Van Jones/Bill Maher: Support tiny Jewish minority post-Holocaust.
- Poem (Nie Moller): Speak out before "they come for you."

## Final Prayer and Blessing
- Sammy Smaja prays in Hebrew/English for Israel, leadership, army, wounded, attendees.
