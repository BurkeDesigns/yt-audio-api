# Teaching: The Mystery of the Magi (Matthew 2:1-12)

## Introduction
- Focus: Identity of Magi, star they followed, gifts brought.
- Key questions: Who were they? Origin? Timing of visit? Not 3 men (tradition from gifts); likely 12+ in caravan, pagan Gentiles from Persia (Medes priesthood, scholars, astrologers, dream interpreters).
- Visited Jesus at 1-2 years old (post-shepherds; house, not manger); Herod's massacre of boys ≤2 based on star timing.
- Daniel likely oversaw Magi (Daniel 5:11); knew prophecies.
- Main takeaway: Personal encounter with Jesus leads to worship; "Who is Jesus to you?"

## The Star
- Seen in east from Persia; reappeared, guided to Bethlehem, "stood over" child (supernatural, not natural phenomenon like Jupiter-Venus conjunction, supernova, comet).
- Speculation: Shekinah glory/Holy Spirit manifestation (visible only to Magi); examples: creation, Abraham, burning bush, pillar of fire, Pentecost tongues.
- Led Gentiles to worship Messiah.

## The Gifts
- Purposeful for divine worship: Gold (deity/king), frankincense (priesthood/duty), myrrh (death/sacrifice).
- **Deity (Gold)**: Jesus as King of kings/Lord of lords (Colossians 2:9; 1 Timothy 6:15).
- **Duty (Frankincense)**: High priest interceding/praying/understanding weaknesses (Hebrews 7:25, 4:15); sole mediator (1 Timothy 2:5).
- **Death (Myrrh)**: Sacrifice atoning once for all (Hebrews 9:28; 1 John 2:2); future kingdom has gold/frankincense, no myrrh (Isaiah 60:6).

## Application & Close
- Jesus must be King (Lord, not self), Priest (intercessor, forgiver), Sacrifice (eternal love).
- Contrast: God asks Adam "Where are you?" (Genesis 3:9); Magi ask "Where is he?" (Matthew 2:2).
- Invitation: Surrender; treat Jesus as Lord/Savior, Priest, Sacrifice.
- Closing prayer for conviction/response.
