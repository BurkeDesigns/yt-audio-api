# Sermon: The Mystery of the Magi

## Speaker

- Pastor Tyler

## Main Passage

- Matthew 2:1-12

## Key Points: The Magi

- Pagan Gentiles from the East (Persian Empire, e.g., Babylon/Persia, northern Iran).
- Priesthood of the Medes (6th century BC); scholars, dream interpreters, royal astrologers.
- Likely influenced by Daniel (Daniel 5:11: appointed chief over magicians).
- Possibly 12+ men in a caravan (not just 3, based on gifts/tradition).
- Visited Jesus aged 1-2 (post-shepherds; Herod's massacre of boys ≤2 years old).
- Worshiped Jesus as divine king; warned in dream to avoid Herod.

## The Star

- "His star" seen in East; guided to Bethlehem, stood over house.
- Not natural phenomenon (e.g., Jupiter-Venus conjunction, supernova, comet).
- Speculation: Angel, Shekinah glory/Holy Spirit manifestation; visible only to Magi.
- Led to rejoicing upon reappearance.

## The Gifts

- Gold, frankincense, myrrh: Symbolic, for worshiping divine.
- **Gold**: Jesus' deity/Kingship.
- **Frankincense**: Jesus' priesthood/duty (intercession).
- **Myrrh**: Jesus' death/sacrifice.
- Fulfilled Isaiah 60:6 (gold/frankincense in millennial kingdom; no myrrh needed).

## Jesus' Deity, Duty, Death

- **Deity**: God in flesh (fully God/man); King of kings/Lord of lords.
- **Duty**: High Priest; intercedes/prays for us, understands weaknesses/temptations.
- **Death**: Once-for-all sacrifice atones for sins.

## Application & Close

- Jesus must be King (Lord), Priest (intercessor), Sacrifice in one's life.
- Contrast: God asks Adam "Where are you?" (Gen 3:9); Magi ask "Where is he?" (Matt 2:2).
- Altar call: Surrender to Jesus as King, Priest, Sacrifice; prayer for raised hands.
