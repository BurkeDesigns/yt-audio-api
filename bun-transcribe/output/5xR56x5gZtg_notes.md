# Sermon Notes: Kingdom of God Present with Power (Transfiguration)

## Speaker
- Pastor Jim (Vero Beach, FL)

## Main Passage
- Mark 9:1-8 (Transfiguration: Jesus takes Peter, James, John up mountain; transfigured, radiant; Moses, Elijah appear; voice from cloud: "Hear Him"; only Jesus remains)

## Key Themes
- **Pressure to Conform vs. Transform**: Culture pressures conformity; God's Word applies greater pressure for inward transformation into God's image
- **Kingdom of God**:
  - Future hope: Jesus' return destroys human governments, brings peace/righteousness (e.g., lion/lamb together)
  - Present reality: Comes with Jesus; experienced via surrender to King; transforms believers into temples/lights; alters values, behavior at home/work/community
- **Transfiguration Reveals Kingdom Power**:
  - Jesus changes from humble humanity to radiant glory (metamorphosis-like)
  - Teaches transformation available now via God's Word and Spirit
- **Do Not Conform, Be Transformed** (Romans 12:2):
  - World applies external pressure (like Play-Doh); resist via mind renewal from Scripture
  - Word discerns soul/spirit (Hebrews 4); corrects thinking/behavior; provides strength
- **Agents of Transformation**:
  - Word of God: Pierces deeply, produces faith, unlocks mysteries
  - Spirit of God (2 Corinthians 3:18): Energizes obedience, beholds Christ's glory, changes "from glory to glory"

## Closing
- Prayer: Thanks God for Word/Spirit's power; requests transformation to reflect Christ
