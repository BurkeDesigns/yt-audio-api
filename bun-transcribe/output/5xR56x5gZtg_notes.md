# Sermon: Kingdom of God Present with Power (Transfiguration)

## Main Passage
- Mark 9 (focus: verses 1-9); Jesus promises some will see kingdom of God present with power.

## Transfiguration Event
- Jesus takes Peter, James, John up high mountain.
- Transfigured: clothes shining white; Moses and Elijah appear, talk with Jesus.
- Peter suggests tabernacles; afraid, doesn't know what to say.
- Voice from heaven: "Hear him"; only Jesus remains.

## Kingdom of God
### Future Hope
- Jesus' return: with clouds/glory (Acts 1), saints (Jude), enemies as footstool (Psalms), stone crushes kingdoms (Daniel), peace/righteousness (prophets).

### Present Reality
- Comes with Jesus; experienced via surrender to King.
- Transforms believers into God's temple/light; affects home, work, community.
- Introduces new value system contrasting culture (e.g., N. Virginia values).

## Transformation (Transfigured/Metamorphosis)
- Complete inside-out change (e.g., caterpillar to butterfly).
- Jesus: humble/human at base, radiant/glorious atop.
- Contrast: Conform (world's external pressure, like Play-Doh) vs. transform (internal, via Word renewing mind).
- Agents: Word of God (pierces soul/spirit, Hebrews 4) + Spirit of God.

### NT Uses of "Transfigured"
- Matthew/Mark: Transfiguration.
- Romans 12:2: Do not conform to world; be transformed by renewing mind.
- 2 Corinthians 3:18: Beholding Lord's glory, transformed into His image by Spirit.
