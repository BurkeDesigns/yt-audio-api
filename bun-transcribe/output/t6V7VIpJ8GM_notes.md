# Sermon Notes: Unity in Christ (Galatians 3:26-29)

## Core Message
- Church welcomes sinners (all are sinners) but rejects tolerance of sin.
- Unity/love/acceptance ≠ endorsement of sin; God defines sin.
- In Christ, all believers are one family with equal standing/value, despite differences.

## What Paul Is Not Saying (v. 28)
- Not erasing distinctions:
  - **Ethnic**: Jew vs. Gentile (e.g., Jews accountable via commandments; Gentiles via conscience; both welcome via Christ).
  - **Socioeconomic**: Slave vs. free (10-20% slaves in Roman Empire via war, crime, debt; Bible condemns slavery/trafficking but instructs believers to serve as unto Lord).
  - **Biological**: Male vs. female (distinct roles: e.g., husbands love wives; wives respect husbands; men teach doctrine; women mentor women).

## What Paul Is Saying
- Natural differences have no bearing on standing in Christ; all equal as Abraham's heirs.
- Counters cultural superiority (e.g., Jewish morning prayer thanking God for not making one Gentile/slave/woman).
- Even Peter showed prejudice (Galatians 2); must check hearts.

## Modern Relevance
- Culture: Erases differences (e.g., trans ideology) or exploits them (division/race/class warfare).
- Church: Most diverse/unified group; unity around Christ/Word, not sin (opposes trans/same-sex marriage as deception, not love).
- Recommended: Interview with Patti Height ("I Thought I Was a Boy") on church YouTube.

## Believer Responsibilities ("One Another" Commands)
- Esteem others better (humility).
- Love one another (discipleship mark).
- Accept/receive one another.
- Be kind/forgiving.

## Closing Prayer
- Embrace differences; love/accept/forgive as Christ did for true unity.
