# Sermon: Unity in Christ (Galatians 3:26-29)

## Key Theme
- Church welcomes sinners (all are sinners) but rejects tolerance of sin; unity/love ≠ acceptance of sinful behavior (e.g., trans movement, same-sex marriage).
- All believers are one in Christ with equal standing/value, despite ethnic, socioeconomic, biological differences.

## What Paul Is Not Saying (Galatians 3:28)
- Differences exist and are not erased:
  - **Ethnic (Jew/Gentile)**: Jews accountable via commandments; Gentiles via conscience (Romans 2); Jesus' light to both (Acts 26).
  - **Socioeconomic (slave/free)**: 10-20% slaves in Roman Empire (prisoners of war, crime punishment, debt); Bible condemns slavery/slave traders (1 Timothy 1:10); instructs slaves to serve as unto Christ (Ephesians 6:5-8); Paul calls self "bondservant" (doulos) of Christ (Galatians 1:10).
  - **Biological (male/female)**: Distinct roles—husbands love wives (Ephesians 5); wives respect husbands; men teach doctrine (1 Timothy 2); women mentor women (Titus 2).

## What Paul Is Saying
- Natural differences have no bearing on standing in Christ; all equal in God's family (Galatians 3:26-29).
- Counters 1st-century Jewish prayer thanking God for not making one a Gentile/slave/woman.
- Even Peter showed Gentile prejudice (Galatians 2; Acts 10).
- Modern relevance: Culture denies differences (e.g., gender fluidity) or exploits them (race/class warfare); church must be diverse yet unified around Christ/Word, speaking truth in love.

## Responsibilities ("One Another" Commands)
- Esteem others better (Philippians 2:3).
- Love one another (John 13:35).
- Accept/receive one another (Romans 15:7).
- Be kind/forgiving (Ephesians 4:32).

## Closing Prayer
- Embrace differences without division; love/accept/forgive as Christ did.
