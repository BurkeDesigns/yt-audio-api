# Sermon Summary: 2 Kings 23-25

## Josiah's Legacy and Death
- Josiah: Best king of Judah, pursued God at 16, reformed nation at 20, destroyed idols completely (ground to powder).
- Died at 39 in unauthorized battle at Megiddo against Pharaoh Neco (Egyptian king en route to aid Assyria).
- Principle: Avoid battles God doesn't call you to fight.

## Succession of Evil Kings
- **Jehoahaz** (Josiah's son): 23 years old, reigned 3 months in Jerusalem; did evil; imprisoned by Neco at Riblah (Syria); tribute: 100 talents silver (3.75 tons), 1 talent gold (75 lbs).
- **Jehoiakim** (Eliakim, renamed by Neco): 25 years old, reigned 11 years; did evil; taxed people to pay Neco; vassal to Nebuchadnezzar (Babylon) for 3 years, then rebelled.
- **Jehoiachin** (Jehoiakim's son): 18 years old, reigned 3 months; did evil; city besieged (597 BC, 2nd deportation: incl. Ezekiel); Nebuchadnezzar took him, family, treasures, 10,000 captives (leaders, craftsmen); left poorest.
- **Zedekiah** (Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, renamed): 21 years old, reigned 11 years; did evil; rebelled against Babylon.

## Babylonian Judgment and Providence
- Nebuchadnezzar rises (605 BC); God uses Babylon (and raiders: Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites) as discipline for idolatry, innocent blood (esp. Manasseh's child sacrifices).
- 1st deportation (606 BC): Daniel and friends.
- Providence: God positions Daniel (influence kings), Ezekiel (preach to exiles), Jeremiah (guide remnant in Judah).
- Principle: Trust God's unseen providence (invisible hand) as much as visible miracles.

## Fall of Jerusalem (586 BC)
- Siege: 588-586 BC (2 years); famine led to cannibalism; wall breached July 16.
- Zedekiah: Fled, captured at Jericho; sons killed before him, then blinded; taken to Babylon.
- Nebuzaradan (captain): Burned temple, king's house, great houses; broke walls; took temple items (bronze pillars, sea, carts, utensils); executed leaders (priests, officers).
- 3rd deportation; poor left as vinedressers/farmers.
- Gedaliah: Appointed governor; advised surrender to Babylon; assassinated by Ishmael (7th month).
- Remnant fled to Egypt fearing Chaldeans.
- Jehoiachin: Released after 37 years (560 BC) by Evil-Merodach; honored at king's table (mercy amid justice).

## Key Principles
- Completely remove sin, don't just set aside.
- God's discipline (painful but loving) purges idolatry; parallels modern innocent blood (65.4M US abortions since 1973).
- God shows mercy even in justice; ends on hopeful note.
