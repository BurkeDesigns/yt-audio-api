# Sermon Summary: 2 Kings 23-25

## Josiah's Death and Legacy
- Best king of Judah; pursued God at 16, reformed nation at 20; destroyed idols completely.
- Died at 39 in battle at Megiddo vs. Pharaoh Neco (Egyptian king en route to aid Assyria); battle not God's call.
- **Lesson**: Avoid battles not yours; fully remove sin.

## Successor Kings
### Jehoahaz (Son of Josiah)
- Age 23; reigned 3 months in Jerusalem.
- Did evil; imprisoned by Neco at Riblah (Syria); Neco imposed tribute (100 talents silver ~3.75 tons, 1 talent gold ~75 lbs).
- Taken to Egypt, died there.

### Jehoiakim (Eliakim, another son; renamed by Neco)
- Age 25; reigned 11 years.
- Did evil; taxed people to pay Neco.
- Vassal to Nebuchadnezzar (Babylon) for 3 years (605 BC), then rebelled.
- God sent raiders (Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites) as judgment for idolatry, innocent blood (e.g., Manasseh's child sacrifices).

### Jehoiachin (Son of Jehoiakim)
- Age 18; reigned 3 months (597 BC).
- Did evil; city besieged; surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar.
- Second deportation: 10,000 captives (leaders, craftsmen); treasures, gold articles from temple taken; poor left.
- Imprisoned 37 years in Babylon.

### Zedekiah (Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle; renamed)
- Age 21; reigned 11 years.
- Did evil; rebelled against Babylon.

## Babylonian Conquests and Judgment
- **606 BC**: First deportation (incl. Daniel, friends).
- **605-597 BC**: Nebuchadnezzar dominates; Egypt loses territory.
- **586 BC**: Final siege (2 years); wall breached July 16; famine led to cannibalism.
  - Zedekiah: Sons killed before eyes, then blinded; taken to Babylon.
  - Nebuzaradan (captain): Burned temple, palace, great houses; broke pillars, sea, carts; took utensils, priests (Serai ah, Zephaniah), officers.
  - Third deportation; poor left as vinedressers.
- End of Jewish sovereignty until 1948.
- Gedaliah (good governor, friend of Jeremiah): Assassinated by Ishmael; remnant fled to Egypt.
- Jehoiachin: Released 560 BC by Evil-Merodach; honored, daily rations.

## Key Themes
- **God's Discipline**: Judgment for idolatry, innocent blood (Manasseh, nation); like parent correcting children (cf. Hebrews 12).
- **Providence**: Positions prophets—Daniel (palace influence), Ezekiel (exiles), Jeremiah (remnant)—despite dark times.
- **Miracles vs. Providence**: God works visibly (miracles) and invisibly (providence); trust Him.
- **Mercy in Justice**: Book ends with mercy to evil Jehoiachin via pagan king.
- Modern parallel: U.S. abortions (65.4M since 1973; 1M+ in 2023).
