# Bible Study: When in Times of Trouble

**Speaker:** Austin

**Scripture:** Psalm 27:1-14 (full psalm read aloud)

## David's Context
- Addresses external conflict (enemies, army encamping; e.g., Saul's pursuit, Absalom's revolt)
- Addresses internal conflict (family; e.g., parents forsaking him)

## Main Teaching Points
- **1. Have confidence in the Lord** (Psalm 27:1-3)
  - Lord is light (wisdom), salvation (Yahweh-shua), strength → no fear
  - Confidence (*batak*): trust, lay life upon Lord amid conflict
- **2. Pursue intimacy with the Lord** (Psalm 27:4-8)
  - Seek to dwell in Lord's house, behold beauty, inquire in temple
  - God hides/conceals in trouble, lifts above enemies
  - Respond to God's call: "Seek my face" → "Lord, I will seek"
  - Seek face (intimacy), not just hand (favors)
- **3. Seek help from the Lord** (Psalm 27:9-13)
  - Plea: Don't hide face, forsake; teach way, lead smoothly, protect from adversaries
  - Lord receives when family forsakes; father to fatherless
  - Believe to see God's goodness in land of living
- **4. Wait on the Lord** (Psalm 27:14)
  - *Kavah*: bind/twist heart to God's (rope imagery; Genesis waters gathered; Achilles tendon analogy)
  - Be courageous; God strengthens heart

## Closing
- Invitation for hands raised in trouble
- Corporate prayer for healing (physical, mental, relational, spiritual); bind hearts to God's
