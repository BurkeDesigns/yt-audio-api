# Bible Study: When in Times of Trouble (Psalm 27)

## Speaker
- Pastor Austin

## Context
- David faces external conflict (enemies, army) and internal conflict (family forsaking him).
- Possible settings: fleeing Saul pre-kingship; Absalom's revolt.
- Applies to modern troubles: work, family, marriage, finances, health.

## Main Points
- **1. Have Confidence in the Lord** (vv. 1-3)
  - Lord as light (wisdom), salvation (Yahweh-shua), strength → no fear.
  - Confidence (*batak*): trust by laying life on Lord amid conflict.
- **2. Pursue Intimacy with the Lord** (vv. 4-8)
  - Seek to dwell in Lord's house, behold beauty, inquire.
  - God hides/conceals in trouble, lifts above enemies.
  - Respond to God's call: "Seek my face" → "Lord, I will seek."
  - Seek face (intimacy), not just hand (favors); trials draw deeper.
- **3. Seek Help from the Lord** (vv. 9-13)
  - Pleas: Don't hide face, teach way, lead in smooth path, protect from adversaries.
  - Lord receives when family forsakes; Father to fatherless.
- **4. Wait on the Lord** (v. 14)
  - Wait (*kavah*): bind/twist heart to God's for strength (rope imagery; Genesis creation).
  - Be courageous; He strengthens heart.

## Closing
- Invitation for prayer support for troubles (physical, mental, relational).
- Prayer for healing, mercy, binding hearts to God.
