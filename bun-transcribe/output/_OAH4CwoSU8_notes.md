## Scripture Reading

## Sermon: "The Greatest Story Ever Told"
- **Joshua Bell illustration**: Violin virtuoso ignored in metro; parallels people rushing past Christmas message.
- **Christmas summary**: God left heaven, born as baby via virgin Mary in Bethlehem to die for sins.
- **Natural elements**: Overcrowded Bethlehem (census), birth in stable/manger, no modern medicine.
- **Supernatural elements**: Virgin conception by Holy Spirit; angel/multitude announcement.
- **Angel's message (Luke 2:10-11)**:
  - **Fear not**: Angels majestic; God's love drives out fear (1 John 4:18, 1 John 4:8); Linus (Charlie Brown) releases blanket.
  - **Good news**: Savior born for sinners (1 Timothy 1:15; John 3:16); beats bad headlines.
  - **Great joy**: Transcends circumstances; found in Jesus (calm delight); "Joy to the World."
  - **All people**: Universal sin (Romans 3:23); free gift of salvation (Romans 6:23), not earned like salary/Santa.
- **Invitation**: "Come home" to God's family; public altar call.
