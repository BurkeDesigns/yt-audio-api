# Galatians 2:11-16 Bible Study: Quiet Christianity vs. Courageous Christianity

## Main Theme
- Contrast between inconsistent "quiet Christianity" (timid, fear-driven hypocrisy) and "courageous Christianity" (consistent, unashamed faith regardless of company).
- Paul confronts Apostle Peter publicly in Antioch for hypocrisy due to fear of Jewish believers ("those of the circumcision").

## Key Incident (Galatians 2:11-16)
- Peter ate freely with Gentiles until men from James (Jerusalem church leader) arrived.
- Peter withdrew, separated from Gentiles, acted kosher out of fear; other Jews (including Barnabas, Paul's companion) followed suit.
- Paul rebuked Peter: "If you, a Jew, live like Gentiles, why compel Gentiles to live as Jews?"
- Core truth: Justification by faith in Christ alone, not works of the law.

## Galatians Context
- Paul planted churches in Galatia (modern Turkey); Judaizers infiltrated post-departure.
- Judaizers: Believed Jesus + Mosaic law (circumcision, kosher, feasts) for true salvation.
- Paul counters: Salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone (no additions).

## Peter's Background
- God used Peter first for Gentiles (Acts 10: Vision of unclean animals; preached to Cornelius, Roman centurion, and household).
- Peter defended Gentiles in Acts 15:7-11 (no burdensome yoke of law; saved by grace like Jews).

## Application & Challenge
- Peter's fear led to mixed signals endorsing Judaizers; hypocrisy influences others.
- Peter's fleshly history: Rebuked Jesus, sank walking on water, denied Christ, cut off ear.
- Distinction:
  - **Sensitivity to liberties** (e.g., meat offered to idols): Curb to avoid stumbling weaker believers (Romans 14:13; 1 Corinthians 8:13).
  - **Embarrassment of beliefs**: Wrong; be unashamed (Romans 1:16; 2 Timothy 1:8; Matthew 10:32-33).
- Avoid "chameleon Christianity" (blending in to fit); live consistently for Christ.
- Goal: Unashamed, unafraid consistency everywhere.

## Overcoming Fear (FEAR Acronym)
- **F**ollow Christ's example: Consistent with all (prostitutes, Pharisees, Jews, Gentiles).
- **E**xpect not everyone will like you (fickle crowds with Jesus; Galatians 1:10; prioritize God-pleasing).
- **A**sk God for boldness (Acts 4:31; Psalm 138:3).
- **R**epent of seeking man's approval over God's.

## Prayers
- Opening: Settle hearts, hear from Spirit (Revelation reference).
- Closing: For consistency, boldness, repentance from quiet Christianity.
