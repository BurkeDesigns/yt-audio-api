# Galatians 2:11-16 Bible Study: Quiet vs. Courageous Christianity

## Context
- Churches in Galatia (ancient Turkey) planted by Paul faced Judaizers: Jews who believed Jesus + Mosaic law (circumcision, kosher, feasts) for salvation.
- Paul corrects: Justification by faith in Christ alone, not works (Galatians 2:16).

## Main Incident
- In Antioch (Syria), Peter ate with Gentiles until men from James (Jerusalem church leader) arrived.
- Peter withdrew, fearing Jewish "circumcision party"; other Jews (including Barnabas) followed in hypocrisy.
- Paul rebuked Peter publicly: Hypocritical to live as Gentile then compel Gentiles to live as Jews.

## Peter's Background
- God used Peter first for Gentiles (Acts 10: Cornelius, Roman centurion; vision of unclean animals).
- Peter defended Gentiles in Acts 15:7-11—no burdensome yoke; saved by grace like Jews.

## Key Theme
- Quiet Christianity: Timid, inconsistent due to fear of others' opinions (Peter's fleshly weakness).
- Courageous Christianity: Unashamed, consistent witness regardless of company.
- Distinction: Biblical sensitivity to others' liberties (e.g., food in Romans 14:13, 1 Corinthians 8:13) vs. embarrassment of gospel beliefs.

## Overcoming Fear (FEAR Acronym)
- **F**ollow Christ's example: Consistent with all (prostitutes, Pharisees, Jews, Gentiles).
- **E**xpect not everyone will like you: People fickle; prioritize pleasing God (Galatians 1:10).
- **A**sk God for boldness: Early church prayer (Acts 4:31); Psalm 138:3.
- **R**epent: Seeking man's approval over God's.

## Prayers
- Opening: Settle hearts, hear Spirit (Revelation reference).
- Closing: For consistency, boldness, repentance from quiet Christianity.
