# Sermon Notes: Stand Your Ground Against the Enemy

## Main Passage
Ephesians 6:10-24

## Ephesians Overview
- Ch. 1-3: Seated in Christ.
- Ch. 4-5: Walk worthy.
- Ch. 6: Stand firm in battle.

## Spiritual Warfare Essentials
- Unseen but real battle vs. Satan/demons (not flesh/blood).
- Satan targets believers: tempts, lies, deceives, discourages, harms marriages/families/faith/churches.
- Origin: Satan's prideful rebellion; 1/3 angels cast to earth as demons.
- Believers: oppressed externally (lies, temptation, conflict); not possessed (Holy Spirit indwells).
- 56% Americans believe Satan real (Barna study).
- Angels minister to believers.

## Four Instructions (Eph 6)
- Identify enemy: principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, spiritual hosts (Eph 6:12).
- Stand firm, no retreat ("stand" x3 in vv. 11,13,14); submit to God, resist devil (James 4:7).
- Strength in Lord's power, not own (Eph 6:10; even archangel Michael deferred: Jude 9).
- Full armor of God (Eph 6:14-18).

## Armor of God
### Defensive
- Belt of truth: Know God's Word to discern lies.
- Breastplate of righteousness: Guard heart.
- Feet shod with gospel of peace: Share gospel to advance light.
- Shield of faith: Quench fear/darts.
- Helmet of salvation: Capture thoughts.

### Offensive
- Sword of Spirit: Quote Scripture.
- Prayer: Always, persevering for saints.

## Closing
- Invitation for battle-weary to stand for prayer.
- God greater than enemy; He fights battles.
