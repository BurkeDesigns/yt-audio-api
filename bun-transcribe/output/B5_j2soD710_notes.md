# Service Summary

## Context
- Study on 2 Kings paused due to Charlie Kirk's assassination.
- Speaker expresses shock and personal grief; Charlie was a friend.
- Brief message from Psalm 13 instead of full sermon; followed by worship songs and early close.

## Speakers
- Unnamed pastor (main speaker).

## Personal Friendship with Charlie Kirk
- Visited Cornerstone 4 years ago; dinner with speaker, Erica, Terry; met local pastors.
- Charlie prioritized pastors' gospel work over his own.
- Flew speaker and Terry to Phoenix event at Dream City Church next year.
- Scheduled keynote at World Outreach Church, Murfreesboro, TN (Pastor Alan Jackson) in ~10 days; uncertain now.

## Key Message from Psalm 13 (A Psalm of David: "Trust in the Salvation of the Lord")
- David shifts from 4 "why/how long" questions (vv. 1-4) to trust, rejoicing, and praise (vv. 5-6).
- OK to ask God "why" (examples: David, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, Jesus on cross quoting Psalm 22:1).
- God not obligated to answer; trust Him amid unanswered questions (partial knowledge now, full later).
- Evil world causes "why" moments (e.g., assassination by "evil demoniac").
- Enemies' temporary "victories" (e.g., silencing voices) do not prevail; truth endures.
- Move from "woe is me" to praising God's mercy/bounty; count blessings, focus on His goodness.
- Do not shrink back from gospel/America despite threats; speaker receives death threats.
- Turning Point's message continues; pray for Kirk family, nation, revival.

## Prayer Focus
- Comfort for Erica (widow), girls, Charlie's parents/friends.
- Healing for nation; fight evil/violence.
- Revival in America; save violent hearts.
- Justice tempered by mercy; hope of heaven/reunion.
- David's example (worship after child's death).

## Closing
- Worship songs: "In Christ Alone," "Jesus You Alone."
- Final prayer for Kirk family, protection, Sunday reunion.
