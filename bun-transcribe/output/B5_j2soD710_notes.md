# Service Summary: Response to Charlie Kirk Assassination

## Context
- Study on 2 Kings paused due to news of Charlie Kirk's assassination.
- Pastor expresses personal shock and grief; Charlie was a friend.

## Personal Friendship with Charlie Kirk
- Hosted Charlie at Cornerstone 4 years ago: dinner with pastor, Erica, Terry; gathered local pastors where Charlie prioritized pastors' gospel work over his own.
- Turning Point USA emphasized gospel's role in changing hearts.
- Next year: Pastor and Terry interviewed at Dream City Church event in Phoenix.
- Upcoming event (in ~10 days): World Outreach Church, Murfreesboro, TN (Pastor Alan Jackson); Charlie as keynote.

## Message: Psalm 13 - "Trust in the Salvation of the Lord"
- David shifts from 4 "why" questions (v1-2) and fear of enemies (v4) to trust, rejoicing, and praise (v5-6).
- Key points:
  - OK to ask God "why" (e.g., Habakkuk, Jeremiah, Jesus on cross); God can handle it but not obligated to answer.
  - Partial understanding now (foggy mirror); full later (1 Cor 13:12).
  - Evil world explains tragedies; Jesus rescues from it; His delay allows repentance.
  - Enemies' temporary "victory" doesn't silence truth; Turning Point/message continues.
  - Move from "woe is me" to "wow, Lord" by counting blessings; focus on God's mercy despite circumstances.
- Application: Don't shrink back from gospel/America despite threats; pastor shares receiving death threats; pray for his family.

## Prayer
- Comfort for Erica (widow), girls, Kirk parents/friends.
- Healing for nation; fight evil; revival to change violent hearts.
- Justice tempered by mercy; hope of heaven/reunion.

## Closing
- Songs: "In Christ Alone," "Jesus You Alone."
- Final prayer for Kirk family, protection, Sunday gathering.
