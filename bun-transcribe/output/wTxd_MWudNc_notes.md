# Sermon: Fatherhood (Father's Day)

## Key Scripture
- Ephesians 6:4 (ESV: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord"; various translations discussed: NKJV, NIV, NLT)

## Speaker's Background
- Honors his father (present; college football, Air Force, CIA; coached speaker; married 62 years; strict but loving).
- Speaker mirrors father's involvement and strictness; poor personal memory of childhood.

## Biblical Examples of Flawed Fathers
- Adam (Cain killed Abel).
- Noah (cursed grandson).
- Abraham (sent Ishmael away).
- Isaac/Jacob (Esau/Jacob rivalry).
- Jacob (sons betrayed Joseph).
- Eli (evil sons as scoundrels).
- Samuel (corrupt sons rejected).
- Gideon (70 sons; one killed others).
- David (70 sons; issues with rape, murder, rebellion, polygamy).
- Lesson: No human experts; model after Heavenly Father.

## Challenges of Fatherhood
- Raise sinful children to maturity amid childish mistakes vs. rebellion.
- Balance provision, work, leadership without provoking anger.
- Countercultural to Roman *patria potestas* (absolute fatherly power); avoid harshness.
- Modern risks: passivity, over-explaining, shielding from adversity.

## 5 Traits of a Loving Father
- **Provides and protects**: Ensures safety and needs.
- **Teaches**: Through words/instruction (not just others); impress God's Word constantly (Deut 6).
- **Leads**: By example/sacrifice; prioritize family over personal pursuits.
- **Disciplines/trains**: Correction/coaching > punishment; daily guidance; builds responsibility, patience, perseverance, maturity/character via opportunities/adversity (not fixing everything).
  - Biblical discipline from love (not wrath); consistency like athletic training.
  - Avoid exasperation (e.g., over-reasoning young kids; "because I said so" has place).

## Practical Advice
- Induce controlled suffering (say no, chores, wait) for growth.
- God/Holy Spirit as model: guides, convicts, assists (like father to kids).
- God's response to Adam/Eve: simple instruction + consequence, no lecturing.
- Parable of Prodigal Son: son's sin not father's fault; repentance welcomed.

## Closing
- Prayer for all fathers: wisdom, patience, courage, Holy Spirit help; God entrusts kids and provides aid.

## Announcements
None.
