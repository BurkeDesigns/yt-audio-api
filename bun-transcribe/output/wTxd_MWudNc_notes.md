# Fatherhood Sermon

## Main Scripture
Ephesians 6:4 (ESV): "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."

## Speaker's Background
- Honors his strict, involved dad (college football, Air Force, CIA; coached speaker; married 62 years).
- Speaker mirrors dad: strictest, most involved per his kids.
- Poor personal memory of childhood; relies on wife/kids for stories.

## Biblical Fathers' Flaws
- Adam: Cain killed Abel.
- Noah: Cursed grandson for son's sin.
- Abraham: Sent Ishmael into desert; Isaac's sons Jacob/Esau conflicted.
- Jacob: Sons sold Joseph into slavery.
- Eli: Sons were scoundrels; appointed them priests.
- Samuel: Sons unfit to lead.
- Gideon: 70 sons; one killed others.
- David: Sons guilty of rape, murder, rebellion; had 700 wives.

**Lesson**: No human fatherly experts; model after Heavenly Father. Kids rebel due to sin nature.

## 5 Traits of a Loving Father
- **Provides and protects**: Meets needs; ensures safety.
- **Teaches**: Instruction/admonition of the Lord (Eph 6:4; Deut 6:5-7); fathers lead spiritually, not just others.
- **Leads**: Role model by example; sacrifice personal pursuits for family; prioritize wife's/kids' best interests.
- **Disciplines/trains**: Correction/coaching > punishment; consistent like athletic training; gives responsibility opportunities (responsibility, patience, perseverance → maturity/character).
  - Avoid provoking anger: Not too harsh (Roman patria potestas context) or too passive/modern absenteeism.
  - Balance: Age-appropriate explanations vs. "because I said so"; induce controlled suffering (say no, chores, disappointment) for growth.
  - God's model: Simple instruction + consequences (Adam/Eve); Holy Spirit parallels (guides, convicts, assists).

## Practical Advice
- Discipline daily via training/coaching.
- Don't fix everything; allow adversity under roof.
- Prodigal Son: Father's love despite son's choices; sin nature responsible.
- Fathers need God's help: Wisdom, patience, courage.

## Closing
- Prayer for standing fathers: Blessing, encouragement, wisdom, Holy Spirit help; God entrusts kids and provides needs.
