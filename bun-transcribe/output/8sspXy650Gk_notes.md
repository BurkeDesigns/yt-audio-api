# Putting Feet to Your Faith (Ephesians 4-5 Survey)

## Ephesians Structure
- Chapters 1-3: Doctrinal (who we are in Christ: chosen, loved, predestined, adopted, redeemed, saved, sealed).
- Chapters 4-6: Practical (how to live out faith).

## Context
- Paul writes from Roman prison but identifies as "prisoner of the Lord" (sovereign God).
- "Walk" (peripateo): Live out faith; used 6 times in ch. 4-5.

## 5 Ways to Walk
- **Walk worthy of the calling** (Eph. 4:1-6)
  - With lowliness/humility, gentleness/meekness, long-suffering/patience, bearing with one another in love.
  - Keep unity of the Spirit (God creates; avoid division over secondary issues like gifts, baptism modes; reject ecumenism with heresy).
  - Unity on essentials: one body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, God/Father.
- **Walk differently than the world** (Eph. 4:17-24)
  - Unlike Gentiles (futility, darkened minds, alienated from God, lewdness).
  - Put off old man (corrupt lusts); put on new man (righteousness, holiness); renew mind.
- **Walk in love** (Eph. 5:1-2)
  - Imitate God as dear children; as Christ loved (sacrificial, patient, merciful, corrective/disciplining).
- **Walk in the light** (Eph. 5:8-11)
  - Once darkness, now light in Lord; produce goodness, righteousness, truth.
  - No fellowship with works of darkness; expose them; let light shine via good deeds.
- **Walk in wisdom** (Eph. 5:15-17)
  - Circumspectly (observant); redeem time (evil days); understand Lord's will; ask God for wisdom.

## Closing Prayer
- For walking worthy, differently, in love/light/wisdom.
