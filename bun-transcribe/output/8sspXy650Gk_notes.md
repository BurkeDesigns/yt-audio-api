# Sermon Summary: Putting Feet to Your Faith (Ephesians 4-5)

## Overview

- Ephesians divides into Ch. 1-3 (doctrinal: who we are in Christ—chosen, loved, predestined, adopted, redeemed, saved, sealed) and Ch. 4-6 (practical: how to live for Christ).
- Paul writes as "prisoner of the Lord" (Eph. 4:1), emphasizing God's sovereignty despite Roman imprisonment.
- "Walk" (Greek: _peripateo_) used 6x in Ch. 4-5; means living out faith practically.
- Analogy: General's wife at wedding rehearsal teaching proper walk.

## Five Instructions to Walk

- **Walk worthy of the calling** (Eph. 4:1-6): Live as "the called" (Christians called out of world); practice lowliness/humility, gentleness/meekness, long-suffering/patience, bearing with one another in love, keeping unity of the Spirit (God creates unity; avoid division over non-essentials; unify on salvation issues like Jesus as Lord, virgin birth, inerrancy, etc.; reject ecumenism with heresy).
- **Walk differently than the world** (Eph. 4:17-24): Unlike Gentiles (unsaved, futile-minded, darkened, alienated from God); put off old man (former corrupt conduct), renew mind, put on new man (righteousness, holiness). Analogy: Change dirty clothes after shower—don't revert to old ways.
- **Walk in love** (Eph. 5:1-2): Imitate God as dear children; love as Christ loved (sacrificial, patient, merciful, corrective/disciplining; not sugary tolerance of sin, but truth-speaking with readiness to receive same).
- **Walk in the light** (Eph. 5:8-11): Once darkness, now light in Lord; bear fruit of goodness/righteousness/truth; no fellowship with dark works—expose them. References Jesus as light bringing freedom from evil/darkness.
- **Walk in wisdom** (Eph. 5:15-17): Walk circumspectly (observant, vigilant) in evil days; redeem time, understand Lord's will (ask God for wisdom).

## Closing

- Prayer for walking worthy, differently, in love/light/wisdom.
