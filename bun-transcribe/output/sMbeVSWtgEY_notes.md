# Sermon: The Mystery of the Rapture

## Opening Exhortation
- Stay alert, discern fake news/false messiahs from truth/real Messiah.
- Christ could return any moment; be ready and faithful.

## Key Scripture Read
- 1 Corinthians 15:50-57: Flesh/blood cannot inherit kingdom; mystery – not all sleep, all changed in twinkling of an eye at last trumpet; dead raised incorruptible; death swallowed in victory.

## Prayer Points
- Be ready for Christ's return; prepare hearts.
- Bless team in Israel; keep safe.

## Biblical Mystery Defined
- Greek: *musterion* – hidden but now revealed (e.g., rapture not in OT, revealed in NT).
- Paul tasked with explaining God's mysteries (1 Corinthians 4:1).
- Secret things belong to God (Deuteronomy 29:29).

## Six Key Biblical Mysteries
- Israel's blindness (Romans 11:25).
- God's will for Christ (Ephesians 1:9).
- Christ and church (Ephesians 3; Colossians 1-2).
- Rapture (focus of sermon).
- Lawlessness/Antichrist (next week; 2 Thessalonians).
- Babylon the Great (Revelation 17).

## Rapture Details (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
### What
- Event: Church *harpazo* (caught up/snatched; Latin *rapturo*).
- 1 Thessalonians 4:17: Caught up in clouds to meet Lord in air.
- All raptured transformed, receive glorified bodies (like Christ's resurrection).

### Who
- Believers from Pentecost (Acts 2) to rapture.
- Two phases: Dead in Christ rise first (1 Thessalonians 4:16), then living caught up.
- Not OT saints or nonbelievers.

### How
- In a *moment*/*atomos* (uncuttable/invisible; quicker than eye blink; 1 Corinthians 15:52).
- Accompanied by trumpet, shout, archangel's voice (1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:52).

### When
- Imminent/unknown (Matthew 24:36; only Father knows).
- At last trumpet (not Revelation judgments).
- Pre-trib view preferred (church rescued before wrath; like Noah/Lot).
- Possible gap before tribulation; church age ongoing.

### Why
- Rescue bride/church from God's wrath (1 Thessalonians 1:10; 5:9).
- Clear way for tribulation judgment on unbelievers.

## Timeline Overview
- 69 weeks of Daniel done; church age now.
- Rapture → possible gap → 7-year tribulation (first 3.5 years peaceful; last Great Tribulation).
- Christ returns with saints/angels → millennial kingdom (1,000 years) → eternity.

## Application (1 Thessalonians 5)
- Be alert, sober-minded, on guard.
- Discern truth; avoid laziness.
- Put on armor of God.
- Encourage/edify one another.

## Closing
- Prayer for holy living, readiness, revival.
- 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24: God keeps spirit/soul/body blameless until Christ's return.
