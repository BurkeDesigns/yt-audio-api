# Sermon Notes: The Mystery of the Rapture

## Opening Exhortation
- Stay alert, discern fake news from real, false messiahs from true Messiah.
- Christ could return any moment; be ready and right with Him.

## Primary Scripture
- 1 Corinthians 15:50-57: Flesh/blood cannot inherit kingdom; mystery revealed—not all sleep, all changed in twinkling of an eye at last trumpet; dead raised incorruptible; death swallowed in victory.

## Opening Prayer
- Thanks for God's work; prepare hearts for Christ's return.
- Be found faithful/blameless.
- Transform lives; bless team in Israel, keep safe.

## Biblical Mysteries
- Greek *musterion*: Hidden but now revealed (e.g., rapture not in OT, revealed in NT).
- Word used ~27x in NT (4x in Revelation).
- Paul as servant explaining mysteries (1 Corinthians 4:1).
- Secret things belong to God (Deuteronomy 29:29).
- Six examples:
  - Israel's blindness (Romans 11:25).
  - God's will for Christ/millennial kingdom (Ephesians 1:9).
  - Christ and church (Ephesians 3; Colossians 1-2).
  - Rapture (1 Corinthians 15).
  - Lawlessness/Antichrist (next week; 2 Thessalonians).
  - Babylon the Great (Revelation 17).

## The Rapture Defined (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
### What
- Event (not prophecy fulfillment) where church *harpazo* (caught up/snatched; Latin *rapturo*).
- Example: Philip in Acts 8.
- Church taken to heaven (1 Thessalonians 4:17); all receive glorified bodies (like Christ's resurrection).

### Who
- All believers since Pentecost (Acts 2) to rapture day.
- Two phases: Dead in Christ rise first (1 Thessalonians 4:16); living believers caught up after.
- Not OT saints or nonbelievers.

### How
- In a *moment/atomos* (uncuttable/invisible; quicker than twinkling eye; 1 Corinthians 15:52).

### When
- Imminent/any moment; unknown except Father (Matthew 24:36).
- At last trumpet (not Revelation judgments; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:52).
- Pre-trib preferred (church rescued before wrath; compares to Noah/Lot).
- Possible gap before tribulation; church age now (post-69 weeks of Daniel).
- Timeline: Rapture → (possible gap) → Tribulation (7 years; split peaceful/Great Trib) → Second Coming → Millennial kingdom.

### Where
- Meet Lord in air/clouds (1 Thessalonians 4:17).

### Why
- Rescue bride/church from God's wrath (1 Thessalonians 1:10; 5:9).
- Clear way for judgment on unbelieving world.

## Application (1 Thessalonians 5)
- Be on guard: Avoid laziness; discern truth; stay alert/sober-minded.
- Put on armor of God.
- Encourage/edify each other.

## Closing Scripture
- 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24: God of peace sanctify wholly; spirit/soul/body blameless at Christ's coming; faithful God will do it.

## Closing Prayer
- Stir to holy living; be ready/right with God.
- No fence-sitting; repent/receive eternal life.
- Stay alert, armored, encouraging amid global revival.
- Rescue from wrath; look forward to next week.
