# Bible Study: 1 Kings 22

## Context
- Divided kingdom: Northern Israel (capital Samaria, King Ahab & Jezebel, wicked); Southern Judah (capital Jerusalem, King Jehoshaphat, wiser).
- Ahab enlists Jehoshaphat to reclaim Ramoth-Gilead from Syrian King Ben-Hadad.
- Jehoshaphat advises seeking God's word first.

## False Prophets
- 400 prophets unanimously urge attack: "Go up, the Lord will deliver it."
- Zedekiah (son of Chenaanah) uses iron horns as props: "Gore the Syrians until destroyed."

## Micaiah's Prophecy
- Ahab hates Micaiah for always prophesying truth (not what Ahab wants).
- Micaiah initially mocks sarcastically, then reveals vision: Israel scattered like shepherdless sheep; Ahab will die.
- Heavenly vision: God seeks someone to persuade Ahab to battle and fall; lying spirit (demonic principality) volunteers, permitted by God (cf. Job 1 scene with Satan).
- Zedekiah strikes Micaiah; Ahab imprisons him on bread/water until return "in peace."
- Micaiah: "If you return in peace, Lord has not spoken."

## Battle at Ramoth-Gilead
- Ahab disguises; tells Jehoshaphat to wear robes.
- Syrians target Jehoshaphat (mistaken for Ahab); he cries out, God diverts them (2 Chronicles 18:31).
- Random arrow hits Ahab between armor joints; propped in chariot, dies at evening.
- Prophecy fulfilled: Dogs lick Ahab's blood (1 Kings 21:19).
- Ahaziah (Ahab's son) succeeds as evil king, serving Baal.

## Jehoshaphat's Reign
- 35 when crowned, ruled 25 years; mostly good like father Asa, but high places remained; allied with Ahab.
- Banished religious prostitutes; no king in Edom (deputy).
- Ships to Ophir for gold wrecked by God at Ezion Geber (due to Ahab alliance); refused Ahaziah's help.
- Jehoram succeeds.

## Key Principles
- God responds to desperate cries (protects Jehoshaphat).
- God's responses should deepen walk with Him (Jehoshaphat brings revival).
- God wrecks plans against His will (ships).

## Prayer Themes
- God's refreshment; deeper walk after deliverance; align with God's plans.

## Speakers
- Teacher (unnamed).
- Biblical: Ahab, Jehoshaphat, Micaiah, Zedekiah.
