# 1 Kings 22 Bible Study Notes

## Opening Theme
- God's responses to desperate prayers should deepen our walk with Him, not lead to forgetting Him.

## Historical Context
- Divided kingdom: North (Israel, capital Samaria, King Ahab & Jezebel, wicked); South (Judah, capital Jerusalem, King Jehoshaphat, wiser).
- Ahab enlists Jehoshaphat to reclaim Ramoth-Gilead from Syrian King Ben-Hadad.

## False vs. True Prophecy
- 400 prophets (led by Zedekiah with iron horns prop) urge attack, promising victory.
- Jehoshaphat requests true prophet: Micaiah son of Imlah (hated by Ahab for truth-telling).
- Micaiah initially mocks agreement, then reveals vision:
  - Israel scattered as sheep without shepherd (Ahab's death).
  - Heavenly scene: God seeks agent to deceive Ahab; lying spirit (demonic) permitted in false prophets' mouths (spiritual warfare; cf. Job).
- Zedekiah strikes Micaiah; Ahab imprisons him (bread/water of affliction).

## Battle at Ramoth-Gilead
- Ahab disguises; tells Jehoshaphat to wear robes.
- Syrians target Jehoshaphat (mistaken for Ahab); he cries out, God diverts them.
- Random arrow wounds Ahab between armor joints; propped in chariot, dies at sunset.
- Prophecy fulfilled: Dogs lick Ahab's blood (1 Kings 21:19).
- Israel scatters; Ahab buried in Samaria.

## Jehoshaphat's Reign (Judah)
- 35 when crowned; ruled 25 years from Asa.
- Mostly good (followed Asa, banished cult prostitutes); flaws: high places remained, allied with Ahab.
- Ships to Ophir wrecked by God at Ezion Geber (due to alliance); rejects Ahaziah's help.

## Succession
- Israel: Ahaziah (Ahab's son) reigns 2 years, wicked (followed Ahab, Jezebel, Jeroboam; served Baal).
- Judah: Jehoram succeeds Jehoshaphat.

## Key Principles
- God responds to desperate cries (protects Jehoshaphat, leading to revival).
- God uses judgment (Ahab) via deception on wicked.
- God wrecks plans against His will (ships).
