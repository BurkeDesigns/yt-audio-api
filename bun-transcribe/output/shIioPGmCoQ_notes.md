## Sermon: Reasons to Rejoice (Philippians Series)
- **Text**: Philippians 2:12-18.
- **Theme**: Reason #5 - Joy when witness impacts world.
- **Key Points**:
  - Obey God (especially in absence of leaders); work out salvation (outwardly display inward work of God) with fear/trembling/reverence.
  - Avoid complaining/disputing to remain blameless, harmless, pure; shine as lights/stars in crooked/perverse generation (dark world).
  - Culture is bent (scoliosis), off God's plumb line; align vertically with God as standard (not man).
  - Live faith out loud; bear fruit; let light shine via good deeds for God's glory.
  - Warning: Avoid world's conforming philosophy; be transformed by renewing mind.
  - Future hope: Christ returns, makes crooked straight.
- Prayer for shining testimony in perverse world.
