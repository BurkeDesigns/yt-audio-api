# 2 Kings 19-20 Bible Study Notes

## Context
- Assyrian Empire dominant power; conquered Northern Israel (723 BC), now threatens Southern Judah (701 BC).
- Assyrians resettled land, intermarried with remaining Jews, creating Samaritans (hostility persists into Jesus' time, e.g., John 4).
- King Sennacherib besieges Judah cities, takes 200,150 captives (per Taylor Prism, British Museum); traps Hezekiah in Jerusalem like caged bird.
- King Hezekiah: Good king who seeks God.

## Key Events (2 Kings 19)
- Hezekiah hears threat, tears clothes, wears sackcloth, enters temple; sends officials (Eliakim, Shebna, priests) to Isaiah prophet.
- Message: Dire situation ("children to birth, no strength"); pray against Rabshakeh's (Assyrian official) blasphemies for remnant.
- Isaiah's reply: God heard blasphemies; do not fear; God will send rumor, cause Sennacherib to retreat and die by sword.
- Rabshakeh leaves for Libnah (hears of Ethiopian King Tirhakah advancing); sends letter taunting Judah's God, listing conquered nations (Gozan, Haran, etc.).
- Hezekiah spreads letter before Lord, prays: Acknowledges God's uniqueness, other gods false; save to prove You alone are God.

## God's Response via Isaiah
- God heard prayer; mocks Sennacherib (Zion despises him).
- Rebukes Assyrian pride (chariots, conquests); God orchestrated their victories to destroy idols.
- Judgment: Hook in nose, send back; sign for Judah—eat self-grown produce years 1-2, full harvest year 3; remnant preserved from Jerusalem.
- Assyrians won't enter city; God defends for His name and David's sake.
- Angel kills 185,000 Assyrians overnight; Sennacherib retreats to Nineveh, killed by sons Adrammelech and Sharezer while worshiping Nisroch; they flee to Ararat; Esarhaddon reigns.

## Hezekiah's Illness (2 Kings 20:1-8)
- Hezekiah sick (boil/sepsis), near death; Isaiah: "Set house in order, you will die."
- Hezekiah prays facing wall, appeals to loyal walk; weeps bitterly.
- God: Heard prayer/tears, heals, adds 15 years, delivers city; uses fig poultice.
- Sign: Shadow retreats 10 degrees on Ahaz's sundial (God controls time).
- Note: Manasseh (wicked son) born in those 15 years.

## Principles
- Prayer: First option, not last resort (Hezekiah learned after initial tribute payment).
- God merciful when cried to; uses medical means (figs) or miracles for healing.
- Praise God as Great Physician regardless of method.

## Speakers
- Main: Unnamed Bible study leader.
- Historical: King Hezekiah, Isaiah (prophet, son of Amoz), Sennacherib, Rabshakeh.
