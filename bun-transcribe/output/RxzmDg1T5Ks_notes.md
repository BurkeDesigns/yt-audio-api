# Bible Study: 2 Kings 19-20 (Wineskin Bible Study)

## Historical Context
- Assyrian Empire dominant (723 BC conquered northern Israel; 701 BC threatens Judah).
- Assyrians resettle land, intermarry with Jews → Samaritans (hostility persists to Jesus' time, e.g., John 4).
- Sennacherib besieges Judah cities, takes 200,150 captives (Taylor Prism evidence); traps Hezekiah in Jerusalem.

## Key Events: 2 Kings 19
- Hezekiah hears threat: tears clothes, wears sackcloth, enters temple.
- Sends officials (Eliakim, Shebna, priests) to Isaiah: describes crisis as exhausted labor; asks prayer for remnant against Rabshakeh's blasphemy.
- Isaiah's response: God heard blasphemy; will send rumor, cause Sennacherib's retreat and death by sword.
- Rabshakeh leaves for Libnah (hears of Tirhakah/Ethiopia); sends letter mocking Judah's God, citing Assyrian conquests (Gozan, Haran, etc.).
- Hezekiah spreads letter before Lord, prays: acknowledges Assyria's power over idols; asks salvation to prove God alone is Lord.

## God's Response via Isaiah
- Heard prayer; mocks Sennacherib (Zion despises him).
- Rebukes Assyrian pride (chariots, cedars, brooks); God ordained their conquests to destroy idols.
- Judgment: hook in nose, return via same way.
- Sign for Judah: eat self-grown food year 1-2, full harvest year 3; remnant preserved from Jerusalem.
- Promise: Assyrians won't enter Jerusalem; God defends for His/David's sake.
- Angel kills 185,000 Assyrians overnight; Sennacherib retreats to Nineveh.
- Sennacherib killed by sons Adrammelech/Sharazir in Nisroch's temple; they flee to Ararat; Esarhaddon reigns.

## 2 Kings 20: Hezekiah's Illness
- Hezekiah (age 39) near death (boil/sepsis); Isaiah: "Set house in order, you will die."
- Hezekiah prays facing wall: appeals to loyal walk; weeps bitterly.
- God: heard prayer/tears; heals, adds 15 years; delivers from Assyria.
- Healing: fig poultice on boil.
- Sign: shadow retreats 10 degrees on Ahaz's sundial (God controls time).

## Principles/Takeaways
- Prayer: first option, not last resort (Hezekiah learned after initial tribute payment).
- God merciful when cried to; uses medical means for miracles (figs like modern medicine).
- Manasseh (evil son) born in extra 15 years (spoiler for next study).

## Closing Prayer
- Thanks for Word; challenge to pray first.
- Praises healing (instant, medical); prays for ill (e.g., lung cancer).
