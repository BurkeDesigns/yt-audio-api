## Core Message: Love Enough to Tell Truth
- Galatians 4:16: Truth provokes enmity (as with Paul, prophets, Jesus).
- World hates light/truth (Christians confront evil).
- Speak biblical truth boldly, graciously for souls' freedom (not popularity).
- Jesus as truth's personification/objective standard vs. subjective "self" morality.
