# Sermon Notes: Response to Charlie Kirk's Assassination

## Speaker
- Pastor (Cornerstone Chapel; personal friend of Charlie Kirk)

## Main Scripture
- Galatians 4:16: "Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?"

## Key Themes
- **Truth-Telling and Persecution**: Speaking biblical truth provokes hatred; expect enmity like Paul faced (Galatians 4:16); Jesus warned of world's hate (John 15:18-19).
- **Evil in the World**: Assassination highlights demonic violence; rising anti-Christian/anti-Semitic hatred; contrast light (truth) vs. darkness (evil, John 3:19-21).
- **Charlie Kirk Tribute**:
  - Founder of Turning Point; outspoken Christian apologist, patriot, family man.
  - Personal ties: Visited Cornerstone (2021); hosted pastor at events (2022-2023); daily texts with pastors.
  - Died on college campus after engaging in dialogue; killer chose violence over debate.
  - Condemns celebrations of death, congressional boos to prayer for family, social media vitriol.
- **Cultural Impact**: Real-time videos intensified trauma; first assassination captured live globally.
- **Jesus as Truth**: Objective standard vs. subjective "my truth"; Christians must boldly proclaim for freedom (John 8:32,36).

## Takeaways
- Love Jesus/people more than life (Philippians 1:20-21); death is gain.
- Do not idolize men (e.g., Paul/Barnabas rejected worship, Acts 14:15); let lives inspire deeper Christ-following.
- Be bold, unashamed ambassadors (Ephesians 6:19-20; Romans 1:16); especially Gen Z/millennials.

## Closing
- Altar call for salvation.
- Prayer for revival, boldness among youth.
