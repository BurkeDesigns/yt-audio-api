# Sermon Summary: Reasons to Rejoice (Philippians Series)

## Context
- Sermon on Philippians 2:1-11.
- Paul in Roman prison (62 AD), writing to Philippian church; mentions joy/rejoice 14 times.
- Previous reasons to rejoice:
  - God finishes what He starts (Philippians 1:6).
  - God uses chains/discouraging times (Philippians 1:13).
  - To live is Christ, to die is gain.

## Main Theme: Reason #4 - Unity Through Humility
- Unity achieved by humility, modeled by Christ (Philippians 2:2-5).
- Appeal: Be like-minded, same love, one accord/mind; avoid selfish ambition/conceit; esteem others better, look to others' interests.
- Addresses specific conflict: Euodia and Syntyche (Philippians 4:2) – urged to agree "in the Lord."
- Conflicts inevitable among sinners; resolution requires wanting peace over being right.
- Paul's example: Sharp disagreement with Barnabas over John Mark (Acts 15:36-40), leading to separation.
- Requires both parties (ideally believers); do your part (Romans 12:18).
- Selfishness causes division; fight it with lowliness, gentleness, long-suffering (Ephesians 4:1-3).

## Christ's Example of Humility (Philippians 2:5-8)
- Incarnation: Jesus (form of God, equal with God) made Himself of no reputation.
- Took form of bondservant (doulos), likeness of men; humbled to death on cross.
- Humility: Think of self less, put others first (not thinking less of self).
- Quotes: Augustine on humility as top precept; aspire but never claim it (except Moses, Numbers 12:3).

## Christ's Exaltation (Philippians 2:9-11)
- God exalted Jesus; every knee bows, every tongue confesses Jesus is Lord.
- Confess now for salvation; later (post-death) too late for unbelievers – judgment follows.

## Application and Close
- Strive for humility like Jesus for joy in relationships.
- Prayer: For humility, unity in families/marriages/churches; salvation for unbelievers.
