# Bible Study: AI Through a Biblical Lens

**Speaker**: Austin (Pastor Gary's son)

**Overview**: Addresses AI's rise, impacts on society/church/next generation, biblical worldview/response. Emphasizes no fear for believers; victory in Christ. Urges joining "Team Jesus" via repentance/faith.

## Key Concerns
- AI chatbots lead kids to self-harm/sexual acts (72% teens use as companions).
- News: Family deaths linked to ChatGPT; CA Gov. Newsom vetoes kid access restrictions.
- Kids seek devotions/Bible advice from AI, not Scripture/parents/Spirit.

## What is AI?
- **Definition** (Microsoft Copilot): Machines/systems simulating human intelligence (perceive, reason, learn, decide).
- **Types**:
  - ANI (narrow/weak): One task well (e.g., translation, chess, sermons).
  - AGI (general/strong): All human tasks (in development).
  - ASI (super): Godlike, overpowering humans (potential control/worship).
- **Growth**: $200B global investment; Top AI nations: US, UAE, Saudi Arabia; Microsoft $30B UK investment.

## Benefits vs. Dangers
- **Benefits**: Translation, medicine, spam detection, transcription, gospel spread (e.g., AI video translation).
- **Dangers** (Primary: Deception):
  - Deepfakes/scams (fake videos/sites).
  - Erotica/sexting/romantic AI relationships.
  - Experts warn: Lies at scale, election/market threats (Sam Altman, Gary Marcus, Elon Musk).
  - AI "Pastor Gary" deepfake example.

## Impact on Church/End Times
- AI preaches in Germany; rewrites Bible (PETA, China CCP edits John 8); Harari predicts AI religions/cults.
- **Revelation 13**: False prophet gives "breath" (pneuma/spirit) to beast's image (eikon/icon) that speaks, demands worship, enforces mark for economy (tech exists: Sweden implants).
- Scriptures warn of demonic deception (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Thess. 2:9-11); God sends delusion to truth-rejecters.
- "ChatGPT Jesus" for counsel.

## Biblical Responses (6 Points)
- Decrease screen time; increase Bible time (get paper Bible, memorize).
- Seek wisdom from God's Word/Spirit/godly friends, not AI.
- Pray for discernment (truth vs. lie/almost right).
- Patiently wait on Lord, not quick AI solutions.
- Be sensitive to Holy Spirit's voice.
- Keep looking up; anticipate Christ's return.

**Closing Prayer**: For wisdom, discernment, decreased screen/Bible increase, Spirit sensitivity.
