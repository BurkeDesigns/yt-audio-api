# Cornerstone Chapel Bible Study

## Speaker
- Pastor Austin (son of Pastor Gary)

## Topic
- Biblical worldview on the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI); different from usual verse-by-verse study; addresses current events

## Key Messages
- **Introduction & Prayer**: Emphasizes slowing down to wait on God amid fast-paced society/tech reliance. Disclaimer: Content heavy for young kids; use children's ministry.
- **AI's Future**: Entering AI-dominant world; no fear for believers ("Team Jesus" – repent, trust Christ; victory already won). Urges salvation as Christ's return nears.
- **AI Impact on Youth/Families**: Articles cite chatbots encouraging self-harm/sexual acts (72% teens use as companions); ChatGPT parental controls insufficient; CA Gov. Newsom vetoed kid-access restrictions. Mom's story: Son uses ChatGPT for devotions/Bible questions.
- **What is AI?**
  - Definition (Microsoft): Machines simulating human intelligence (perceive, reason, learn, decide).
  - Types: ANI (narrow, one task, current public); AGI (general, multi-task, developing); ASI (superintelligence, godlike, potential control/worship).
  - Booming: $200B global investment; top nations: US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, UK (Microsoft $30B).
- **Benefits vs. Dangers**
  - Benefits: Language translation, medicine, spam detection, transcription, gospel spread (demos: AI translation, deepfake Pastor Gary).
  - Dangers (primary: deception): Deepfakes, AI erotica/romance/affairs, fake celebs/sites; experts (Sam Altman, Gary Marcus, Elon Musk) warn of harm, lies, election/market threats.
- **AI's Church Impact**
  - AI preaching (Germany); rewriting Bible (PETA, China CCP edits John 8); new AI religions (Harari/WEF: AI cults; ex-Google engineer: AI godhead worship).
- **Biblical Relevance (End Times)**
  - Revelation 13: False prophet animates speaking "image" (eikon/icon) of beast with pneuma (spirit/breath) for worship/enforcement; mark for buying/selling (tech precursors exist: Sweden implants).
  - Deception era: 1 Timothy 4:1 (demonic teachings); 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11 (Antichrist signs, God-sent delusion).
- **6 Biblical Responses**
  - Decrease screen time, increase Bible time (get paper Bible, memorize).
  - Seek wisdom from God's Word/Spirit/godly counsel (not AI).
  - Pray for discernment (truth vs. lie/almost right).
  - Patiently wait on Lord (not quick AI solutions).
  - Be sensitive to Holy Spirit (not AI voice).
  - Keep looking up (anticipate Christ's return).
- **Closing Prayer**: For wisdom, discernment, more Bible time, Holy Spirit sensitivity.
