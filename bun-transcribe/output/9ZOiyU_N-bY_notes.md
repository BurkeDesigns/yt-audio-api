# 1 Chronicles Bible Study: Genealogies (Ch. 2-6)

## Intro/Recap
- 1-2 Chronicles: One Hebrew book ("Words of the Days"), post-exile (after 70 yrs Babylon), for returnees unaware of homeland/history.
- Likely by Ezra; repeats Samuel/Kings; survey approach skips repetitive genealogies.

## Ch. 2: Judah to David
- Line: Judah → Perez → Hezron → Ram → Amminadab → Nahshon → Salmon → Boaz → Obed → Jesse → David (7th son; sometimes 8th if one died).
- Other Judah lines: Hezron, Jeremiah, Caleb.

## Ch. 3: David's Family & Judah Kings
- Hebron sons (7.5 yrs reign): Amnon (Ahinoam), Daniel/Chileab (Abigail), Absalom (Maacah), Adonijah (Haggith), Shephatiah (Abital), Ithream (Eglah).
- Jerusalem sons (33 yrs): Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon (Bathsheba); 9 more unnamed + concubines' sons; daughter Tamar.
- Dysfunction: Amnon rapes half-sister Tamar; Absalom (full brother) kills Amnon.
- Kings from Solomon → Rehoboam → ... → Zedekiah (last, 586 BC exile).

## Ch. 4: Judah & Simeon
- Judah: 4th son, first due to David/Messiah line.
- **Jabez** (v9-10): Honorable; prayed for blessing, enlarged territory, God's hand, kept from evil/pain-causing; God granted.
- Simeon (2nd son): Wanderers (villages/cities/pastures); cursed for Shechem massacre (overkill vengeance for Dinah's assault).

## Ch. 5: Reuben, Gad, Manasseh (East of Jordan)
- Reuben (1st son): Lost birthright to Joseph's sons (Manasseh/Ephraim) for sleeping with father's concubine Bilhah.
- Reuben/Gad/half-Manasseh: Stayed east (pastures); unfaithful to God, chased foreign gods; exiled by Assyria (Tiglath-Pileser).

## Ch. 6: Levi (3rd Son)
- Line: Levi → Kohath → Amram → Aaron/Moses/Miriam.
- David's Levite musicians/singers (to Solomon's temple): Heman (Kohathite); sons of Korah (despite Korah's rebellion/swallowing in Numbers).

## Key Lessons
- Jabez: Prayer > ambition/achievement for honor.
- Simeon: Guard vs. unrestrained anger (justice yes, overkill no).
- Reuben: Guard vs. sexual sin (outside marriage).
- East tribes: Stay close to God/believers; distance breeds idolatry/vulnerability.
- Korah: Families can have redemptive stories via Christ.

## Closing
- Prayer: Thanks for redemption despite flaws; new family heritages possible.
