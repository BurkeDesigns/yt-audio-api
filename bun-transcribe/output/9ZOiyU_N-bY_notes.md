# 1 Chronicles Bible Study: Chapters 2-6 (Recap and Survey)

## Background on Chronicles
- Hebrew Bible: One book (*Divrei Hayamim*, "Words of the Days"); last book in Hebrew canon.
- Written post-exile (after 70 years in Babylon under Cyrus); for returnees unfamiliar with homeland/history.
- Likely by Ezra (unnamed); repetitive of Samuel/Kings; survey approach skips detailed verse-by-verse and genealogies.

## Key Genealogies
### Judah (Ch. 2-4; leads to David/Messiah)
- Sons: Er, Onan, Shelah (by Canaanite); Perez/Zerah (by Tamar).
- Line: Judah → Perez → Hezron → Ram → Amminadab → Nahshon → Salma → Boaz → Obed → Jesse → David (7th son; sometimes listed 8th due to deceased brother).
- David's family (Ch. 3):
  - Hebron (7.5 yrs): Amnon (Ahinoam), Daniel/Chileab (Abigail), Absalom (Maacah), Adonijah (Haggith), Shephatiah (Abital), Ithream (Eglah).
  - Jerusalem (33 yrs): Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon (by Bathsheba/Bath-shua); 9 more unnamed mothers; concubines' sons; sister Tamar (raped by Amnon; avenged by Absalom).
- Kings of Judah: Solomon → Rehoboam → ... → Jehoiakim → Jeconiah/Zedekiah (last, 586 BC exile).
- Jabez (4:9-10): Honorable; prayed for blessing, enlarged territory, God's hand, protection from evil/pain; God granted.
- Simeon (Ch. 4): Wanderers (villages/cities/pastures); due to Genesis 34 massacre of Shechem men.

### Reuben, Gad, Half-Manasseh (Ch. 5; east of Jordan)
- Reuben (firstborn): Lost birthright to Joseph's sons (Manasseh/Ephraim) for sleeping with father's concubine Bilhah.
- Gad (7th son), half-Manasseh: Stayed east of Jordan for pastures; vowed to fight with brothers.
- Unfaithful: Worshiped local gods; exiled by Assyria (Tiglath-Pileser) to Halah, Habor, Gozan.

### Levi (Ch. 6; priestly/musical line)
- Sons: Gershon, Kohath, Merari.
- Kohath → Amram → Aaron, Moses, Miriam.
- David's appointees: Levite musicians/singers (Kohathites, e.g., Heman); served tabernacle until Solomon's temple.
- Sons of Korah: Descendants served as worship leaders despite Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16).

## Key Lessons/Principles
- **Jabez**: Prayer (for favor/protection) > ambition/achievement; honorable pursuit.
- **Simeon**: Guard against unrestrained anger (overkill in justice).
- **Reuben**: Guard against sexual sin (outside marriage); forfeits birthright.
- **East tribes (Manasseh etc.)**: Avoid distance from God/believers; stay in fellowship (Hebrews 10:25) to resist pagan influence.
- **Korah**: Families can have redemption; one generation's rebellion doesn't define future (descendants as worship leaders).

## Prayer Close
- Thanks for redemption despite flawed humanity (e.g., Reuben, Simeon, Korah); Christ changes family stories/heritage.

## Announcements
None.
