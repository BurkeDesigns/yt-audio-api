# Cornerstone Chapel New Year Q&A Session

## Speakers
- Pastor Gary Hamrick (lead)
- Tyler (son)
- Austin (son)

## Overview
- Holiday-format annual Bible Q&A across all three services; pre-submitted and live questions prioritized by broadest appeal.
- Straight-through-Bible series pauses; resumes Philippians next Sunday.

## Key Q&As
### Satan/Demons and Thoughts/Prayer
- No scriptural evidence demons/Satan access thoughts/hearts (God alone omniscient/omnipresent).
- Pray silently if concerned; audible prayer fine (God bigger); demons guess via patterns.

### Purpose of Prayer
- Not vending machine for wants; aligns heart with God's will (e.g., Gethsemane: "not my will").

### Depression
- Some chemical (see doctor); others life stresses.
- Sermon ref: "Help God, I'm Depressed" (1 Kings 19, March 2015, teaching library).

### Talmud/Quran/Book of Mormon
- Talmud: Jewish commentary on OT (historical, not inspired).
- Quran/Book of Mormon: Angel-inspired claims contradict Bible (errors, post-Biblical); avoid as inspired.

### Gifts of Holy Spirit
- Continuationist: Still active today until eternal state (not canon closure); for church edification (1 Cor 12); love central.

### Baptism for Salvation?
- No; response to salvation by faith/grace (Titus 3:5-7); like wedding ring (public declaration).
- Examples: Thief on cross, Cornelius (Acts 10); "for" in Acts 2:38 means "in response to" forgiveness.

### Bible Translations
- Switched NIV (1984) to NKJV due to 2011 NIV revisions (e.g., John 3:16 attribution).

### Unpardonable Sin
- Rejecting Jesus as Lord/Savior.

### Supporting Israel
- Biblical: Eternal Abrahamic covenant (land/people); Messiah from Jews; God not done (Rom 11:25-26; Zech 12-13).
- Political: Only democracy amid hostile Muslim states.
- OK to critique government/corruption; US aid military (not to "wicked kings").

### Quick Answers
- Levels of heaven: No.
- Gog/Magog: Before tribulation (leads to Armageddon).
- God's silence: Not anger.
- The Chosen: Entertainment; use discernment (artistic liberties).

### Satan Sinning in Heaven
- Angels chose rebellion (pride); no repentance for angels; humans redeemed/incorruptible in eternity.

### Christian Yoga?
- Roots in Hindu pantheism ("union with universe"); poses/meditation problematic; stretch cautiously, avoid philosophy.

### Eternal Punishment (Kirk Cameron/Annihilationism)
- Reject: Bible teaches eternal torment (Matt 25:46; Rev 20:10,14-15); hell for Satan/angels, humans choose via rejection.
- Work theology privately; platform demands clarity.

### Afterlife Terms
- Sheol/Hades: OT/NT holding for dead (pre-Christ divided; now unbelievers).
- Gehenna: Lake of fire equivalent.
- Tartarus: Fallen angels (Gen 6?).
- Abyss: Wicked angels/Antichrist.
- Paradise emptied post-resurrection.

### Catholic Bible/Transubstantiation
- Extra books (Apocrypha): Intertestamental, uninspired (no Jesus/apostles quotes; contradictions, e.g., alms for sins).
- Transubstantiation: No; symbolic/spiritual (John 6:63); elements remind of sacrifice.

### Forgiveness (e.g., Abortion)
- Yes: Sins removed "east from west" (Ps 103:12); no condemnation (Rom 8:1); enemy accuses.

### Millennial Jobs
- Yes: Assignments post-return (Dan 12:11-13 interval); co-reign (2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4-6); temple build (Ezek 40-48).

### Spouse Qualities
- Men: Loves/seeks Lord/Word, serves, integrity, humble, employed (not boy/selfish).
- Women: Loves Lord/Word, not self-absorbed/flirtatious.

### Practical/Theological
- YouTube ads: Church doesn't monetize; YouTube inserts.
- 144,000: Jewish evangelists (Rev 7,14; 12k/tribe) in tribulation.
- Toxic people: Biblical to limit (1 Cor 5; Ps 1); pray, be salt/light.
- Wilderness season: Dryness/discouragement; remember God's kindness (Ps 63); deepens intimacy.
- Sinner's prayer: Biblical aid to confess/repent/believe (Rom 10:9-10); decision starter.
- Anxiety: Cast cares (1 Pet 5:7); pray/thanksgiving for peace (Phil 4:6-7).
- Public school: Personal; prioritize spiritual over academics/athletics; agenda worsened.
- Babylon: Likely literal revived (Rev 17-18; Iraq); occult epicenter.
- Matt 7:21-23: False prophets (works-based); true believers trust Christ alone.
- Earth age: Young (~6-10k years; genealogies).
