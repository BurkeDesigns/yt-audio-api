## Key Q&A Topics

### Satan/Demons and Thoughts/Prayer
- No access to thoughts/hearts (God alone omniscient/omnipresent).
- Pray silently if concerned; audible prayer fine (Satan guesses patterns).
- Prayer purpose: Align heart with God's will, not change God (Gethsemane example).

### Depression
- Some chemical (see doctor); others from life stress.
- Sermon: "Help God, I'm Depressed" (1 Kings 19, Mar 2015, teaching library).
- Pray; read raw Psalms (David's discouragement).

### Talmud/Quran/Book of Mormon
- Talmud: Jewish commentary on OT (historical, not inspired).
- Quran/Book of Mormon: Angel-inspired claims; contradictions with Bible; avoid as inspired.

### Spiritual Gifts
- Continuationist: Gifts active today until eternal state (1 Cor 13:8-13 "perfection" = glorification).
- For church edification (1 Cor 12:7,11); love central.

### Baptism and Salvation
- Not required (Titus 3:5-7; faith alone); public declaration post-salvation.
- Acts 2:38 "for" = response to forgiveness (e.g., Cornelius, thief on cross).

### Bible Versions/Unpardonable Sin
- NKJV preferred (NIV 2011 revisions problematic; old NIV unavailable).
- Rejecting Jesus as Lord/Savior.

### Supporting Israel
- Biblical: Eternal Abrahamic covenant (Gen 12,15); Messiah's people; future salvation (Rom 11:25-26; Zech 12-13).
- Political: Only democracy amid 56 Muslim states.
- Critique governments OK; US aid military (humanitarian to Gaza separate).
- Remember Oct 7 context.

### Satan/Lucifer Sin in Heaven
- Angels chose (pride); no repentance (fate sealed).
- Humans redeemed; glorified state incorruptible (no sin).

### Yoga
- Roots in Hinduism/pantheism (union with universe); caution on poses/meditation.
- Stretch OK; reject philosophy (biblical meditation = fill mind with truth).

### Hell/Eternal Punishment
- Eternal (Matt 25:46; Rev 20:10,14-15); vs annihilation (Kirk Cameron questioned, but unsubstantiated).
- Created for Satan/angels; God desires repentance.

### Afterlife Terms (OT/NT)
- Sheol/Hades: Dead (pre-Christ divided; now unbelievers' holding).
- Tartarus: Fallen angels (2 Pet 2:4).
- Abyss: Wicked angels/Antichrist.
- Gehenna/Lake of Fire: Final judgment.
- OT salvation: Faith in future Messiah.

### Catholic Bible/Transubstantiation
- Apocrypha (7 extra books): Not quoted by Jesus/apostles; inconsistent (e.g., alms atone sins).
- Communion: Symbolic reminder, not literal flesh/blood (John 6 spiritual).

### Forgiveness (e.g., Abortion)
- Full (Ps 103:12); no condemnation (Rom 8:1); enemy accuses.

### Millennial Jobs
- Yes; assignments post-return (Dan 12:11-13 interval; 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4-6).

### Spouse Qualities
- Men: Pursue Lord/Word, integrity, humble, employed.
- Women: Love Lord/Word, not self-absorbed.

### Practical Issues
- YouTube ads: Church not monetized (YouTube inserts).
- 144,000: Jewish Tribulation evangelists (Rev 7,14).
- Toxic people: Distance OK (1 Cor 5; Ps 1); pray.
- Wilderness season: Spiritual dryness; press into Word (Ps 63); reveals God's kindness.
- Sinner's prayer: Biblical aid for decision (Rom 10:9-10; repent = change mind).
- Anxiety: Cast cares (1 Pet 5:7); pray/thank (Phil 4:6-7).
- Condemnation vs conviction: No condemnation in Christ (Rom 8:1); conviction leads to confession.
- Public school: Personal; prioritize spiritual over academics/athletics.
- Babylon: Likely revived literal (Rev 17-18); US possible but epicenter Middle East.
- Matt 7:21-23: False prophets (works-based); true believers secure.
- Young earth: ~6-10k years (genealogies); book: *The Beginning of the World* (Henry Morris).
