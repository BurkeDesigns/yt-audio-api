# Sermon Notes: Torn Between Two Worlds

## Series and Passage
- **Series**: Reasons to Rejoice (Philippians; joy mentioned 14 times).
- **Passage**: Philippians 1:19-25.
- **Speaker**: Pastor (Cornerstone Chapel).

## Background
- Paul writes from Roman prison (~62 AD) awaiting trial before Nero; later released, then re-arrested and beheaded.
- Philippi church prays for Paul; gospel reaches Caesar's household, leading to salvations.
- God sovereignly placed Paul there (Acts 23); uses circumstances for His purposes.

## Reasons to Rejoice (Philippians Ch. 1)
- God finishes what He starts (v. 6).
- God uses chains/circumstances for divine purposes.
- **Core Verse**: "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain" (v. 21).
  - Paul torn between life (fruitful ministry for Philippians' progress/joy) and death (with Christ, "far better").
  - Not a death wish, but a "heaven wish" (longing to finish well, welcome heaven when God calls).
  - Illustrated by Phil Wickham's "Homesick for Heaven" lyrics.

## Heaven Description (5 Points)
- Dwelling place of God; eternal home for believers (immediate upon death via faith in Christ).
- Beyond outer space ("third heaven").
- Streets of gold, gates of pearl, jasper walls, crystal river.
- Illuminated by God's glory and Jesus (no sun/moon).
- Reunions with believing loved ones (recognition retained/enhanced).

## Closing Challenge
- "To live is Christ" prerequisite for "to die is gain."
- Surrender to Christ as Lord/Savior; name in Lamb's Book of Life.
- Altar call/prayer for salvation.
