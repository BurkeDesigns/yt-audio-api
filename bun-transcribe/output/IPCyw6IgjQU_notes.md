# Sermon Summary: Torn Between Two Worlds (Philippians 1)

## Context
- Sermon at Cornerstone church; series "Reasons to Rejoice" through Philippians.
- Paul writes from Roman prison (~62 AD) under Nero, awaiting trial for preaching gospel.
- Philippi church (Greece) prays for Paul; some in Caesar's household saved via Paul's imprisonment.
- God directed Paul to Rome (Acts 23); prison advances gospel despite chains.

## Previous Reasons to Rejoice
- God finishes what He starts (Phil 1:6).
- God uses chains/circumstances for divine purposes (gospel spread in prison).

## Key Passage (Phil 1:19-25)
- Paul's deliverance via prayers and Spirit (v19).
- Boldness to magnify Christ in life or death (v20).
- **Core verse**: "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain" (v21).
- Torn: Live = fruit/labor for others; die = be with Christ (far better, v23).
- Paul confident to remain for Philippians' progress/joy (v24-25); hopes to visit again.

## Main Theme: No Death Wish, But "Heaven Wish"
- Not suicidal; work unfinished, desires to mentor Philippians.
- Heaven wish: Long to finish well on earth, welcome heaven when God calls.
- Life's weariness fosters this (e.g., Phil Wickham's "Homesick for Heaven" lyrics: ache for heaven's no-pain reunion, worship).

## 5 Facts About Heaven
- God's dwelling/eternal home for believers; immediate entry upon death (no purgatory/soul sleep).
- Beyond outer space ("third heaven").
- Streets of gold, pearl gates, jasper walls, crystal river (spectacular colors).
- Lit by God's glory/Jesus (no sun/moon).
- Reunions with saved loved ones (recognition; glorified bodies, full knowledge).

## Conclusion/Call
- Death = graduation for Christians; requires "to live is Christ" first.
- Critique living for money/fame/success (Eccl lesson: meaningless without God).
- Surrender to Christ as Lord/Savior; name in Lamb's Book of Life.
- Closing prayer/altar call for salvation; free Bible offered.
