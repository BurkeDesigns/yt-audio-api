# Sermon Summary: Torn Between Two Worlds

## Context and Series
- Series: "Reasons to Rejoice" through Philippians (started couple weeks ago).
- Paul writes from Roman prison (~62 AD) to Philippi church; joyful despite chains for preaching gospel.
- Background: Awaiting trial before Nero; shares gospel with Caesar's household, leading to salvations (divine appointment).
- God told Paul in Acts he'd testify in Rome (omitted prison detail).

## Scripture Focus
- **Philippians 1:19-25** (key: v21 "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain"; torn between life on earth for ministry vs. being with Christ).

## Reasons to Rejoice (3 total so far)
- #1: God finishes what He starts (Philippians 1:6).
- #2: God uses chains/circumstances for divine purposes.
- #3: "To live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Philippians 1:21) – reason for joy as outcome is win-win.

## Key Themes
- Not a death wish, but "heaven wish": Desire to finish well on earth, welcome heaven when God calls (no suicidal intent; Paul expects to return to Philippi).
- Contrast: Death wish (dark, reckless) vs. heaven wish (longing for no pain/sorrow; like Phil Wickham's "Homesick for Heaven").
- Heaven overview (5 points):
  1. God's dwelling place; immediate home for believers upon death (no purgatory/soul sleep).
  2. Beyond outer space ("third heaven").
  3. Streets of gold, pearl gates, jasper walls, crystal river.
  4. Illuminated by God's glory/Jesus (no sun/moon).
  5. Reunions with believing loved ones (recognizable).

## Application and Call
- Must first say "to live is Christ" (surrender to Jesus as Lord/Savior) to claim "to die is gain."
- Warning: Living for money/fame/success meaningless without God (Ecclesiastes).
- Salvation prayer offered; Bibles for new believers (in-person or text 703-844-9969).
