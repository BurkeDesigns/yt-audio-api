# Kneel in the Depths: Paul's Prayer for Unshakable Strength

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Ephesians 3:14-21** as you work through this guide.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read Acts 19 and Acts 20—what key events marked Paul's time in Ephesus, and how might they shape his words here?
2. Consider Paul's situation when writing Ephesians: Where was he, under what ruler, and to whom was he writing? How does this backdrop influence his posture and requests?
3. Compare this prayer to the one in Ephesians 1:15-19—what progression do you observe in Paul's concerns for these believers?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
### Observation: What stands out in the text?
1. In verse 14, note Paul's physical posture as he begins to pray—what does this reveal about his approach, and how does the rest of the passage unfold from there?
2. List each of the four "that" requests Paul makes (verses 16-19)—what key elements (like source, location, means, or results) does he connect to each one?
3. Scan verses 17b-19: What dimensions does Paul mention about Christ's love, and how does he describe its relationship to knowledge and fullness?
4. Observe verses 20-21: To whom does Paul direct praise, and what words highlight the scale of God's ability?

### Interpretation: What does this mean?
1. Based on verse 16, where does Paul say true strength comes from, and what contrasts might it offer against human weariness?
2. In verse 17a, what does it look like for Christ to "dwell in your hearts"—unpack the word choice and the role of faith here?
3. Verses 17b-19 invite grasping Christ's love: What clues in the text suggest this is more than head knowledge, and how vast does Paul claim it to be?
4. Verse 19 speaks of being "filled with all the fullness of God"—according to the prayer's flow, what prepares the way for this?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence with God and journal your honest responses:
1. In what areas of your inner life do you sense the most weariness right now—why might that be?
2. When you picture Christ dwelling comfortably in your heart, what occupies that space instead, and why?
3. How have you experienced (or missed) the dimensions of Christ's love in your life—why does it feel distant or overwhelming?
4. What keeps you from being filled with God's fullness—whose presence do you truly crave more?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, kneel (or adopt a posture of deep reverence) and pray Paul's exact four requests *for someone else* facing hostility or weariness—then watch for how God's power works "exceedingly abundantly" through it.
