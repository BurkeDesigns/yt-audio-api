# Blessing or Curse? God's Enduring Covenant with Israel

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Genesis 12:1-3** and **Romans 11:25-26**. Keep these passages in front of you as you study.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who was Abram (later Abraham), and what do you notice about his background and God's call to him in the broader story of Genesis?
2. In the letter to the Romans, what tensions were Paul addressing between Jewish and Gentile believers? How does this setting shape his words in chapters 9-11?
3. Consider the historical scattering of the Jewish people (exile) and their return to the land—how might prophecies like Ezekiel 36-39 connect to events around 1948?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In Genesis 12:1-3, what specific promises does God make to Abram and his descendants? What conditions, if any, do you observe?
2. Scan Romans chapters 9-11: What reasons does Paul give for God's ongoing faithfulness to Israel, even amid their unbelief or rebellion?
3. In Romans 11:25-26, what mystery does Paul reveal about "all Israel"? How does this challenge ideas that God has fully replaced or abandoned the Jewish people?
4. Look at Revelation 12:10 and 12:13—what role does Satan play in accusing or pursuing God's people? How does this connect to patterns of hatred described in Scripture?
5. In Ephesians 5:11 and 2 Timothy 2:23-26, what actions are believers called to take against unfruitful deeds or foolish disputes? What approach does Proverbs 18:17 suggest for handling opposing views?
6. Read John 8:44—who does Jesus identify as the source of lies and murder? How might this illuminate spiritual battles involving blame and hatred?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:
1. Where in your own heart do you see fear, suspicion, or indifference toward the Jewish people or Israel—and why might that be there?
2. When have you witnessed or participated in blame-shifting or conspiracy-thinking? What deeper attitudes toward God does this reveal in you?
3. How does God's faithfulness to imperfect people (like Israel or yourself) stir hope or resistance within you right now?
4. If God distinguishes between critiquing actions and hating a people, where do your words or silences fall short?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one conversation, post, or news story involving criticism of Israel or the Jewish people. Before responding (or choosing silence), prayerfully revisit Genesis 12:1-3 and Romans 11:25-26—then act or speak in a way that aligns with blessing rather than cursing.
