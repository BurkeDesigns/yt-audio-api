# More With Us Than With Them: Unveiling the Unseen Battles

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **2 Kings 6:8-23** and **2 Kings 6:24 - 7:20**. Keep these pages in front of you as you explore.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who is Elisha, and how does his ministry connect to Elijah? Scan earlier chapters in 2 Kings (like chapters 2-5) for clues about his calling and previous acts.
2. What was the ongoing conflict between the king of Syria and Israel? Notice the location of Dothan—cross-reference Genesis 37:17 and consider why God might highlight this spot.
3. During the siege of Samaria, what extreme conditions gripped the city? Research Ben-Hadad and the historical tensions to see why desperation led to blame and doubt.

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)

### Observation: What Do You See?
1. In 2 Kings 6:8-14, list the Syrian king's repeated plans and King Jehoram's responses. What role does Elisha play in each incident?
2. Track the servant's reaction in 2 Kings 6:15 and Elisha's exact words in verses 16-17. What dramatic change occurs after Elisha's prayer?
3. In 2 Kings 6:18-23, observe step-by-step what Elisha prays for the Syrian army, how he leads them, and the outcome in Samaria. Note any feasting details.
4. In 2 Kings 6:24-33 and 7:1-9, catalog the famine's horrors, Elisha's prophecy, the doubting officer's words, and what the four lepers discover. What sounds does God use?

### Interpretation: What Does It Reveal?
1. Based on 2 Kings 6:16-17, what does Elisha know about the unseen reality that the servant initially misses? How might this connect to times when enemies seem overwhelming?
2. In 2 Kings 6:18-23, why does Elisha show such unexpected treatment to the blinded army? What shift happens in the raiders afterward?
3. Compare the doubting officer's question in 2 Kings 7:2 with Elisha's response. What does the lepers' discovery in 7:3-9 suggest about God's methods in crisis?
4. Across 2 Kings 6-7, what patterns emerge in how God protects, provides, and uses unlikely people? How do human fear, faith, and obedience interplay?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence with God and journal your honest responses:
1. When in your life have you felt surrounded by "them" more than "us"? Why did fear dominate your view?
2. What "unseen" realities of God do you suspect are active around you right now, but struggle to perceive? What holds your spiritual eyes closed?
3. Recall a time doubt mocked God's promises in your heart—like "even if windows open?" Why did you question His power then?
4. The lepers hesitated to hoard good news—what keeps you from sharing breakthrough moments God has given you?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one person or situation feeling like an "enemy" or overwhelming force. Pray Elisha's prayer (adapt 2 Kings 6:17) for eyes to see God's greater presence, then extend mercy or share a specific good news from your life—like a feast for foes—without expecting return. Track what God reveals through their response.
