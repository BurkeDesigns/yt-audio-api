# When Nations Align Against God's People: Ezekiel's Warning

**The Anchor Text**  
Have your Bible open to *Ezekiel 38*. Read the full chapter slowly before beginning.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Research the ancient regions named in Ezekiel 38:2-6 (like Magog, Rosh, Meshech, Tubal, Persia). Where were they located geographically, and how might that shape the coalition described?
2. What condition must Israel be in for this invasion to occur (Ezekiel 38:8, 11)? Look up surrounding chapters in Ezekiel or related prophecies—why would this seem impossible?
3. Consider nearby prophecies like Isaiah 17:1. What events precede or align with Ezekiel 38, and how do they involve key Middle Eastern players today?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What stands out in the text?**  
1. In Ezekiel 38:2-6, who leads the invasion, and which specific nations join as allies? Note their order and any repeated emphasis on their unity.  
2. Scan Ezekiel 38:7-12—what draws this coalition to attack Israel? List the motivations and Israel's described state (verses 8, 11-12).  
3. Who speaks up in Ezekiel 38:13, and what do they question? Contrast their role with the attackers.  
4. Observe Ezekiel 38:18-23—what sequence of events does God unleash? Count the disasters and note how they affect both attackers and the earth itself.  

**Interpretation: What does this reveal about God, nations, and the future?**  
1. Based on verses 2-6 and historical identifications, what patterns emerge in the coalition's makeup (geography, religion, or power)? How does verse 12 explain their aim?  
2. Why do verses 18-23 shift from human plans to divine action? What phrases show God's purpose in the chaos (e.g., "I will...")?  
3. Compare Ezekiel 38:18-23 with Revelation 16:16-21 and Revelation 19:11-16. What similarities in earthquakes, hail, and kings point to a larger culmination?  
4. In light of Psalm 121:4 and Luke 21:28, how does this chapter reframe fear of global alliances or current conflicts?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)  
Sit in silence with God over these questions:  
1. When world events echo Ezekiel 38—like shifting alliances or threats to Israel—why does your heart lean toward anxiety rather than awe?  
2. What in your life feels like an "undefended village" (Ezekiel 38:11), and why might God allow such vulnerability before His move?  
3. Reflecting on God's self-magnifying display (Ezekiel 38:23), why do you sometimes doubt His intervention in your personal battles?  
4. As redemption draws near (Luke 21:28), what hidden fears about the future reveal where your hope truly rests?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)  
This week, track one major world event involving Israel, Russia, or Iran. Journal how Ezekiel 38 illuminates it—not to predict dates, but to declare aloud God's sovereignty (as in verse 23). Share your insight with one person, inviting them to read the chapter themselves.
