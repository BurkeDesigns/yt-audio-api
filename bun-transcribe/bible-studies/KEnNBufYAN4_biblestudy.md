# Idols on the Throne: When Compromise Conquers a Kingdom

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **2 Kings chapters 16 and 17**. Read the full chapters straight through before answering any questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Research the divided kingdom after Solomon—note the capitals of Israel (North) and Judah (South). How does this division set the stage for the events in these chapters?
2. Look up the Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser III and Shalmaneser V, along with their typical policies toward conquered peoples. Why might hiring or rebelling against them have been a desperate move for Israel's neighbors?
3. Investigate the timeline from Israel's Exodus to the fall of Samaria (around 725-722 BC). What patterns emerge in how God dealt with rebellion over centuries?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
### Observation: What stands out in the text?
1. Scan 2 Kings 16:1-4 and 17:1-6. What specific wicked practices are described for King Ahaz of Judah and King Hoshea of Israel? List any military alliances or responses to enemies mentioned.
2. In 2 Kings 16:7-18, trace Ahaz's actions step-by-step after facing threats—what does he take from the temple, and what new altar does he introduce? Note the role of Uriah the priest.
3. Examine 2 Kings 17:7-23 closely. Make two lists: (a) the sins of Israel over 725 years, and (b) God's repeated responses and warnings through prophets. What sparks the final conquest and exile?
4. Observe 2 Kings 17:24-41. What happens after the Assyrians resettle foreigners in Samaria? Describe the lions' role and the resulting religious practices.

### Interpretation: What does this reveal about God, people, and consequences?
1. Based on 2 Kings 16:3 and the surrounding threats, what does Ahaz prioritize in a crisis—his safety, his worship, or something else? How do verses 17-18 show his submission shifting?
2. In 2 Kings 17:13-18, why does God say the exile happened, despite His patience? Compare Israel's fate to Judah's ongoing story.
3. Cross-reference Isaiah 7:14 (spoken amid Ahaz's time). Amid all the idolatry and alliances, what unexpected promise emerges about God's future plan?
4. Reflect on the syncretism in 2 Kings 17:32-41—fearing God ritually while serving other gods. What does this pattern teach about partial obedience?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence with God for these questions. Journal your honest responses.
1. Where in your own life have you hired "Assyrian help"—worldly solutions or approvals—to escape pressure, even if it alters your worship?
2. Why do you think Israel's 725 years of warnings were ignored? What similar "stiff-necked" resistance do you notice in your heart toward God's voice?
3. Consider leaders like Uriah or the syncretistic priests: When have you obeyed people or culture over God to avoid conflict, and why did that feel easier?
4. Amid judgment, God inserts hope (like Isaiah 7:14). Where do you need to see His sovereign mercy breaking through your current compromises?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify **one specific "altar of compromise"** in your life—something you're mixing with true worship, like a habit, alliance, or ritual that dilutes surrender to God. Boldly dismantle it (remove access, confess it, replace it with Scripture meditation), and watch for God's lions (wake-up calls) or glimmers of hope as you trust His justice and patience over quick fixes.
