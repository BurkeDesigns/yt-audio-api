# Idols in Disguise: Will You Fear God or the Lions?

## The Anchor Text
Keep these passages open in your Bible as you study:  
**Second Kings 17:34-41** and **Second Kings 18**.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Investigate the fall of the Northern Kingdom to Assyria around 722 BC—what happened to the people of Israel, and who were resettled in their place? (Consider Second Kings 17:24-33 for clues.)  
2. Who were the Samaritans historically, and why did Jews and Samaritans harbor such deep prejudice toward each other? (Search Luke 9:51-56 and John 4 for examples.)  
3. What was the bronze serpent's original story, and how did its role change over time? (Look up Numbers 21.)

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What do you see?**  
1. In Second Kings 17:34-41, list every way the people "feared" the Lord alongside their other practices—what patterns emerge in their worship?  
2. Scan Second Kings 18:1-8—what specific actions did Hezekiah take to remove idols, including something from Israel's past? Why might that surprise you?  
3. In Second Kings 18:13-37, observe the Assyrian Rabshakeh's words at Jerusalem's wall—what does he mock about Hezekiah's trust, reforms, and God? Note his language choices and offers.  
4. Compare the people's response in Second Kings 18:36-37 to Hezekiah's command—what does their silence reveal about leadership in crisis?  

**Interpretation: What does it mean?**  
1. Based on Second Kings 17:34-41, what does "fearing the Lord" look like when it's mixed with old habits—does it lead to true covenant obedience?  
2. From Second Kings 18:3-7, what sets Hezekiah apart from other kings in his trust and reforms—how does this connect to outcomes like success in war?  
3. In Second Kings 18:19-35, how does the Rabshakeh twist Hezekiah's actions (like temple tribute) and invoke God—what assumptions does he make about surrender and alliances?  
4. Reflecting on the entire chapter, what do Hezekiah's compromise (verses 14-16) and the officials' torn clothes (verse 37) suggest about trading the sacred for temporary relief?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence with God for these questions:  
1. Where in your life might "good things" from your past—like a once-helpful habit or memory—have quietly become idols that compete with wholehearted worship?  
2. Why do you think you sometimes mix fear of God with fear of consequences, like lions or accusations—what's pulling your heart?  
3. When facing intimidation or false claims, why do you respond with defense instead of silence and trust—what fear drives that?  
4. What sacred part of your life (time, resources, relationships) are you tempted to "strip" for peace with the enemy—why does that feel necessary right now?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one "good thing" in your life that has become an idol (like Hezekiah destroyed the serpent). Take bold action to remove it—destroy, repurpose, or surrender it fully to God—and journal how trusting Him alone changes your peace amid pressures.
