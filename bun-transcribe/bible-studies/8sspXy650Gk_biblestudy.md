# Putting Feet to Your Faith: How Will You Walk Today?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Ephesians chapters 4 and 5**. Keep these pages in front of you as you study—let the words speak directly.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read Ephesians 4:1—who is writing, and what does he call himself? How might his circumstances influence the urgency of his words?
2. Observe the overall flow of Ephesians: What themes dominate chapters 1-3, and how does chapter 4 mark a change? Why might this shift matter for everyday believers?
3. Look up the Greek word translated "walk" (peripateō) in Ephesians 4-5 (it appears multiple times). What everyday action does it evoke, and why is it repeated?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Walk Worthy of the Calling (Ephesians 4:1-6)**  
1. In verses 1-3, what specific attitudes does the writer urge to maintain unity? List them from the text—how do they connect to being "called"?  
2. Verses 4-6 list seven "one"s—what do they reveal about what unifies believers? Where might we risk division instead?  

**Walk Differently Than the World (Ephesians 4:17-24)**  
3. Compare verses 17-19 (describing Gentiles) with verses 20-24 (describing followers of Christ). What three commands in verses 22-24 show the process of change?  
4. Verse 24 describes the "new self"—what qualities define it? How does this contrast with the "old self" in verse 22?  

**Walk in Love (Ephesians 5:1-2)**  
5. Verse 1 calls believers "dear children"—what action toward God does this imply? How does verse 2 define Christ's love?  
6. What kind of love does Christ model here? Does it match what the world calls "love"?  

**Walk in the Light (Ephesians 5:8-11)**  
7. Verse 8 declares a transformation ("you were once darkness, but now..."). What three fruits should "light" produce (verse 9)?  
8. Verses 10-11 instruct about "deeds of darkness"—what two responses are commanded, and why no "fellowship"?  

**Walk in Wisdom (Ephesians 5:15-17)**  
9. Verse 15 urges walking "circumspectly"—what does "redeeming the time" (verse 16) look like in "evil days"?  
10. Verse 17 points to "understanding what the will of the Lord is." What blocks this, and what enables it?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence. Journal your honest responses:  
1. Which "walk" from Ephesians 4-5 exposes the biggest gap between your calling in Christ and your daily steps? Why do you think that gap exists?  
2. When have you sensed God's unity calling you to patience or humility lately? What held you back, and what might God be inviting you to release?  
3. In moments of darkness or folly this week, whose "light" or "wisdom" did you follow—Christ's or the world's? Why that choice?  
4. If Christ walked sacrificially for you (Ephesians 5:2), what fear keeps you from imitating that love today?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, select **one** of the five "walks" that most convicted you. Intentionally practice it in three specific relationships—at home, work, or church—tracking in a journal how it impacts unity, exposes darkness, or redeems your time. Report back to God (and a trusted friend) what you discover about His power in your steps.
