# Whose Voice Will You Heed?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **1 Kings 22** and keep it in front of you throughout this study.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Investigate the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah at this time—who ruled each, what were their capitals, and how did their spiritual conditions differ? (See also 1 Kings 16:29-33 for background on Ahab.)
2. Locate Ramoth-Gilead on a map or in Scripture—what prior conflict involved this city, and why might reclaiming it appeal to the kings? (Consider 1 Kings 20.)
3. Research King Jehoshaphat's family line and reputation—how does his approach to decisions contrast with typical kings of his era?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
### Observation: What Do You See?
1. Scan verses 1-12—what do the 400 prophets say unanimously, and what dramatic props does Zedekiah use to make his point? Note any repeated phrases or actions by the kings.
2. In verses 13-28, observe Micaiah's first response, then his true vision—how does he describe Israel's future army and its leader? What heavenly scene does he reveal, and who initiates the deception?
3. Track the battle preparations and outcomes in verses 29-39—what disguises are used, who is targeted first, and how does Ahab meet his end? Cross-reference 1 Kings 21:19.
4. Notice Jehoshaphat's role throughout (verses 29-33 and beyond)—what happens when he cries out, and how does the chapter shift to his reign (verses 41-50)?

### Interpretation: What Does It Mean?
1. Compare the 400 prophets' words with Micaiah's prophecy—why might Ahab prefer one over the other, and what risk does Micaiah take by speaking?
2. In Micaiah's heavenly vision, who permits the lying spirit, and how does this reveal God's control over events and messages? (Compare with Job 1.)
3. Reflect on the battle's random arrow and Ahab's fate—what patterns emerge about ignoring true prophecy versus heeding desperate cries?
4. Consider Jehoshaphat's alliances and reforms—what tensions exist between his "mostly good" rule and his choices, like the wrecked ships?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence with God and journal your honest responses to these questions:
1. When have you faced a chorus of voices urging you forward, and why did (or didn't) you seek a dissenting truth?
2. What "disguises" do you wear to avoid consequences, and why might God allow chaos to expose them?
3. In moments of crisis, whose voice have you cried out to first, and why does that reveal about your trust?
4. How does the reality of spiritual deception stir unrest in your heart right now?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, before making any significant decision (work, relationships, or plans), identify one potential "Micaiah"—a truthful voice or Scripture that might challenge the majority opinion—and commit to hearing it fully before acting. Journal what God reveals through obedience.
