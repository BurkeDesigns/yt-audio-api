# From Counterfeit Stones to the Living Cornerstone

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **First Peter chapter 2**. Keep **First Corinthians 15:31** nearby for reference.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who was Peter writing to in First Peter, and what challenges were they facing that made ideas of "rejection" and "living stones" especially relevant? (See First Peter 1:1-2.)
2. In the culture of Peter's time, what made claiming Jesus as the "cornerstone" a radical, counter-cultural stand? Research the imagery of stones and builders in ancient building practices.
3. What daily realities did Paul face that led him to say in First Corinthians 15:31, "I die every day"? How does this connect to Peter's audience?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. Read First Peter 2:1-3. What specific actions does Peter urge believers to put away, and why might these be linked to spiritual "cravings" for unhealthy substitutes?
2. In First Peter 2:4-8, observe the repeated contrasts between stones—living, chosen, precious versus rejected and stumbling. Who does the choosing, and what happens to those who reject the cornerstone?
3. Scan First Peter 2:9-10. List the new identities given to those once "not a people" but now called out. How does this shift describe a path from isolation or confusion to belonging?
4. Now look at First Corinthians 15:31 alongside First Peter 2:11-12. What does "dying daily" look like in the context of abstaining from fleshly lusts that wage war against the soul?
5. Based on the whole of First Peter 2, what patterns emerge about how rejection (by people or self) interacts with responses to God's chosen stone?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:
1. Where in your life have you built on "counterfeit cornerstones" like rejection, unmet longings, or self-protection—and why do you think those appealed to you?
2. What hidden "lusts" or confusions wage war in your soul right now, and what fears keep you from laying them fully at the feet of the Living Stone?
3. If Jesus sees you completely and still calls you to His chosen people, why might you still feel like an outsider or unworthy?
4. Imagine dying daily to one specific struggle this week—what deeper heart issue from your past might God want to address first?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one "counterfeit cornerstone" in your life (a rejection, longing, or habit you've clung to for identity or comfort). Intentionally lay it down by declaring aloud First Peter 2:9-10 over yourself daily, then take one practical step to "abstain" from it—replacing it with time pursuing Christ as your true foundation. Track what shifts in your freedom.
