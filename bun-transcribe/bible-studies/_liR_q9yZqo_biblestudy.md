# Faith or Folly? Unmasking the Path to True Righteousness

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Galatians 3:1-25** as you study. Keep these pages marked—you'll return to them often.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who was Paul writing to, and where were these churches located? What false teaching was creeping in among them (look ahead to verses 1-5 for clues)?
2. Research Abraham's life (cross-reference Genesis 12-17). How long before the giving of the Law at Sinai did God make His key promise to him? Why might Paul start here?
3. What do the Judaizers demand for full acceptance with God? Scan Old Testament examples like circumcision or dietary laws—why would this appeal to new believers?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In verses 1-5, what vivid accusation does Paul level at the Galatians? What evidence from their own experience does he point to as proof of the Spirit's work?
2. Verses 6-9: What happened to Abraham that made him "righteous"? Examine the timing—how does this challenge any idea that the Law was always required?
3. Verses 10-12: What curse does Paul describe for those relying on the Law? Read the quotes from Deuteronomy and Habakkuk—what single principle from Habakkuk 2:4 does he spotlight?
4. Verse 13: How does Christ personally intervene in this curse? Connect the imagery of "hanging on a tree" back to Deuteronomy 21:23—what exchange is happening here?
5. Verses 14 and 19-25: What promise to Abraham now reaches Gentiles like us? What three roles does Paul assign to the Law (hint: standard, revealer, guide)? Once Christ arrives, what happens to its role?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence before each question. Let the Holy Spirit search you.
1. Why do you ever feel pressure to "earn" God's approval through your performance?
2. In what areas of your life do you treat the Law (or your own rules) like a mirror—seeing the mess but staying stuck?
3. What fears surface when you consider resting fully in Christ's finished work, without adding your efforts?
4. Why might God design faith as the sole path to righteousness—what does that reveal about His heart toward you?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify **one specific habit or mindset** where you're mixing your works with faith for spiritual standing (e.g., "If I pray more, God will love me more"). Journal what Scripture from Galatians 3 reveals about it, then replace it daily with a simple declaration of trust in Christ's redemption—aloud, three times a day. Track what shifts in your heart by week's end.
