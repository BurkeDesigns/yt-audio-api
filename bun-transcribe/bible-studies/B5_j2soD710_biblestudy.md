# From Lament to Trust: Wrestling with God in the Dark

## The Anchor Text
**Psalm 13**  
*(Keep your Bible open to this passage throughout the study.)*

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who is the author of Psalm 13, and what do you know about his life from other Scriptures (such as 1 Samuel or 2 Samuel)? How might his experiences shape the raw honesty in this psalm?  
2. Scan the Book of Psalms—how common are laments like this one, and what examples can you find of other biblical figures bringing desperate "why" questions to God (consider Habakkuk 1, Jeremiah 20:7, or Jesus' words on the cross)?  
3. Read 1 Corinthians 13:12—what does this reveal about our current ability to understand God's ways, and how might that connect to moments of suffering?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In verses 1-4 of Psalm 13, list every question David asks God. What emotions or fears do these reveal about his situation?  
2. Notice the sudden shift between verse 4 and verse 5—what words or phrases mark this change, and what reasons does David give in verses 5-6 for his trust and rejoicing?  
3. Compare Psalm 13:5-6 with Isaiah 51:12 and Hebrews 12:2—how do these passages describe God's character or actions that could fuel trust during enemy opposition?  
4. In Psalm 22:1 and 2 Samuel 12:23, observe how lament and grief play out—what patterns emerge about turning pain toward hope or praise?  
5. Based on the full psalm, what truths about enemies, evil, or temporary "victories" stand out, and how does David counter them without denying his pain?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:  
1. When have your own "how long" or "why" questions lingered unanswered—what feelings surface as you revisit them now?  
2. Why might it feel risky to voice raw honesty to God like David did, and what holds you back from that vulnerability today?  
3. In your current struggles, where do you see God's past mercy or salvation most clearly, and why haven't you leaned into that trust yet?  
4. What "enemy victories" in your life tempt you to shrink back—why do they feel so final, even if Scripture suggests otherwise?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one personal "why" moment where pain or evil looms large. Each day, read Psalm 13 aloud, then spend 5 minutes recounting three specific instances of God's faithfulness in your life—shift intentionally from lament to praise, and share that praise with one other person.
