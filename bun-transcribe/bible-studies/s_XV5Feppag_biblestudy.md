# Grace Alone or Gospel Distorted?

## The Anchor Text
Galatians 1:1-10  
*(Keep your Bible open to this passage as you work through the study.)*

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read Acts 13-14. What cities did Paul visit during his first missionary journey, and what challenges did he face there that might explain the urgency of this letter to the Galatian churches?  
2. Who were the "Judaizers" influencing these churches (consider Galatians 1:6-9 and the cultural tensions between Jewish customs and new faith in Jesus)? Why would their message appeal to new believers?  
3. Around 49 AD, what was happening in the early church that made Paul's defense of his apostleship so personal and forceful?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In verses 1-2, how does Paul describe the source of his authority as an apostle? What does this reveal about his relationship to other leaders or human approval?  
2. Scan verses 3-5. What human problem does Paul highlight, and what specific actions of Jesus does he say address it? How is this presented as good news?  
3. Verses 6-9 repeat strong language twice—what exactly is being "perverted" according to Paul, and what consequences does he pronounce on those promoting it?  
4. In verse 10, what shift does Paul make about his identity and motives? How does the original language (like "bondservant") deepen this?  
5. Look ahead briefly to Galatians 2:16. How does this connect to the gospel Paul defends here—what role does the law play versus faith?  
6. Compare with 1 Corinthians 3:1 or 2 Thessalonians 3:10. In what ways did Paul correct other churches, and how does that pattern appear in Galatians 1?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence with God for these questions:  
1. Where in your own spiritual journey are you aware of adding "something extra" to simple faith in Christ—and why does that feel safer?  
2. What fears or doubts surface when you consider relying solely on grace, without your efforts or achievements?  
3. Why might your heart resist the freedom Paul insists on here—what past experiences or influences contribute to that resistance?  
4. In quiet, ask: How has "Jesus plus anything" subtly shaped your view of God, and what longing does that stir in you?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one specific habit or belief where you're blending your performance with Christ's work (like earning approval through religious routines). Intentionally release it daily by praying Paul's gospel summary from Galatians 1:3-5 aloud, then act in freedom—observe and journal what shifts in your heart and relationships.
