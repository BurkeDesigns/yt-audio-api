# Have I Become Your Enemy by Telling the Truth?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Galatians 4:16**. Keep nearby: **John 15:18-19**, **Philippians 1:20-21**, **John 8:32**, and **John 8:36**.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read **Galatians 1:1-10**. Who was Paul writing to, and what personal risks was he facing as he defended his message?
2. Look up the background of the Galatian churches (use a study Bible or reliable commentary). Why might Paul's truthful words have stirred such strong opposition?
3. Scan **John 18:37-38**. In what setting did Jesus speak of truth as a defining mark of His kingdom, and how did those around Him respond?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In **Galatians 4:16**, what pointed question does Paul pose to his readers? What clues in the surrounding verses (Galatians 4:12-20) reveal why relationships had turned hostile?
2. Read **John 15:18-19**. What reasons does Jesus give for why the world might hate His followers? How does this connect to being "not of the world"?
3. Examine **John 3:19-21**. What contrast does Jesus draw between light and darkness? What specific behaviors expose people's true preferences?
4. In **John 8:31-36**, what promise does Jesus link to abiding in His word? How does He describe the alternative state of those who reject truth?
5. Turn to **Philippians 1:20-21**. What attitude does Paul express about life, death, and Christ? What shift in priorities does this reveal amid potential persecution?
6. Read **Acts 14:15** and **Ephesians 6:19-20**. When people tried to elevate Paul and Barnabas, how did they redirect attention? What prayer does Paul request for his own boldness?
7. In **Romans 1:16**, what does Paul declare about the gospel? Notice any link to shame or fearlessness—what stands out?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence. Journal your honest responses:
1. When have you sensed tension or rejection after sharing what you believe is true? What fears surface in those moments?
2. Why do certain truths from Scripture feel risky to voice in your daily circles right now?
3. In what areas of your life are you more drawn to approval from others than to Christ? What might that reveal about your deepest allegiance?
4. How does the reality of evil or opposition in the world affect your willingness to live as light? Why?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, prayerfully identify one conversation or situation where truth from God's Word could bring freedom. Speak it boldly as an ambassador, then journal the outcome—response, your fears faced, and any gain in Christ.
