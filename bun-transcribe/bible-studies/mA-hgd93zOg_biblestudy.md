# Standing Unshaken: Facing the Unseen War

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Ephesians 6:10-24**. Read it slowly several times before answering the questions below.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Scan Ephesians chapters 1-3, 4-5, and 6. What progression of "postures" do you observe in how believers are called to live (see Ephesians 1:20; 2:6; 4:1)?
2. Who wrote this letter, and under what circumstances? Consider Paul's situation as he closes the letter (Ephesians 6:19-20).
3. Why might a message about "standing firm" have been vital for the church in Ephesus at that time?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What do you see in the text?**
1. In verses 10-14, what action is repeated three times, and what does the passage urge believers *not* to do?
2. According to verse 12, who (or what) is *not* the enemy, and who *is*? List the specific descriptions given.
3. Examine verses 14-17 closely. What six pieces of "armor" are named? Which seem defensive, and which offensive? Note any body parts or actions they protect or enable.
4. What is the role of prayer in verse 18? How does it connect to the rest of the armor?

**Interpretation: What does it mean?**
1. Verse 10 points to the source of strength. Where does it come from, and why might that matter in a battle?
2. Based on the armor descriptions, what kinds of attacks (lies, doubts, fears) do they counter? Look for clues in the text itself.
3. In verses 19-24, how does Paul model reliance on this strength? What does he request for himself and others?
4. The passage warns of an unseen battle (verse 12). What evidence in the text shows this fight is real and ongoing for believers?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Let the Holy Spirit search your heart.
1. Where in your life right now—marriage, family, faith, or relationships—do you sense an unseen pressure or attack, and why do you think it's targeting you there?
2. When have you retreated instead of standing firm? What fear or lie held you back, and what truth from Ephesians 6 challenges that?
3. How aware are you of your own spiritual armor? Which piece feels weakest right now, and why might God be highlighting it?
4. Imagine the enemy's strategy against you personally. What "fiery darts" keep coming, and what does it reveal about the battles God has equipped you to win?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, each morning, physically "put on" the full armor of God from Ephesians 6:14-18—stand, speak it aloud over your body and day, naming each piece and its purpose. When an attack hits (fear, temptation, doubt), identify the specific armor piece to wield and use it immediately. Journal one victory by week's end.
