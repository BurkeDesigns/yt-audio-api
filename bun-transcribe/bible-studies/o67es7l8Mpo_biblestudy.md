# Breakthroughs Begin on Your Knees: Discovering God's Path to True Victory and Worship

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **1 Chronicles 14-15** and keep it in front of you throughout this study.

## Contextual Investigation
1. What key events led up to these chapters? Look back at 1 Chronicles 13—what went wrong in David's first attempt to move the Ark, and where did it end up for three months?
2. Research the significance of the Ark of the Covenant in Israel's history (consider what it contained and symbolized). Why might centralizing it in Jerusalem have been a bold move for David?
3. Look up the Valley of Rephaim and the Philistines' history with Israel. What made David's response to their raids different from typical ancient battles?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation**:  
1. In 1 Chronicles 14, what resources does Hiram king of Tyre provide to David, and what does David recognize about his own kingdom (verses 1-2)?  
2. List all the sons born to David in Jerusalem (verses 3-7). Now, turn to Deuteronomy 17—what command for kings does this seem to multiply?  
3. When the Philistines raid in verses 8-12, what does David do before attacking, and what unique name does he give the place of victory? What happens to the idols they leave behind (cross-reference Deuteronomy 7:5, 25)?  
4. In the second battle (verses 13-17), what specific instructions does God give David, and how far are the Philistines routed?  
5. In 1 Chronicles 15, how does David prepare the Levites and priests for transporting the Ark (verses 1-15)? What changes from the previous attempt, and what rituals do they perform to sanctify themselves?  
6. Who are appointed as musicians and leaders in the procession (verses 16-24), and what instruments and sounds fill the air? What does David wear, and what sacrifices are offered?  
7. Scan the chapter: Where is Michal mentioned or implied, and what contrasting attitude does she show (cross-reference 2 Samuel 6:23)?

**Interpretation**:  
1. Based on verses 10 and 14, what pattern emerges in David's battles? What might this reveal about facing enemies?  
2. Why do you think God insisted on shoulder poles carried by Levites rather than an ox cart (compare Exodus 19)? What does this teach about handling holy things?  
3. What clues in the procession (shouting, instruments, David's attire) point to the tone of true worship? How does this contrast with a king's typical display?  
4. Considering the blessings at Obed-Edom's house and the victories, what connection do you see between obedience to God's instructions and breakthrough?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence with God for these questions:  
1. In what current "battle" in your life have you charged ahead without first inquiring of God? Why did you choose that path?  
2. When have you treated God's presence casually, like an ox cart instead of reverent shoulders? What fears or distractions keep you from true sanctification?  
3. Why does your heart sometimes despise "undignified" worship, like David's dance? What control or image are you clinging to?  
4. Reflecting on David's fame spreading through obedience, why do you pursue victory your way instead of God's?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one area of opposition or decision where the "enemy" seems to pursue you. Before acting, *inquire of God* twice—first for direction, then for confirmation—through prayer and searching Scripture. Obey precisely, no matter how counterintuitive, and note what "breakthrough" or blessing follows.
