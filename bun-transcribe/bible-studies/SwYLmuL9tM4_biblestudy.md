# Unshakable Joy: Does God Really Finish What He Starts?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Philippians 1:1-11**. Keep **Philippians 2:12-13** nearby as well. Read the anchor text aloud twice before beginning.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Research the city of Philippi—who founded it, its cultural makeup, and population size. How might this setting make Paul's words especially bold?
2. Trace Paul's connection to Philippi: When and how did he first establish the church there? Where was he when writing this letter, and what challenges was he facing?
3. Scan the entire book of Philippians. How often do words like "joy" or "rejoice" appear, and why might that stand out in a letter from prison?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In verses 1-2, who is writing, to whom, and with what greeting? What titles or descriptions catch your eye, and what do they reveal about relationships?
2. Examine verses 3-6 closely. What triggers Paul's joy and thanksgiving? List every phrase showing his confidence about their future—what "work" does he mention, who starts it, and until when does it continue?
3. In verses 4 and 8, how does Paul describe his prayers and feelings? What contrasts with his imprisonment do you observe?
4. Look at verse 9-11. What does Paul pray will "abound" in them, and why? How does this connect back to the "good work" in verse 6?
5. Compare Philippians 2:12-13 with 1:6. What roles do believers and God each play in this ongoing process? What tensions or harmonies do you notice?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Let the Holy Spirit search your heart.
1. When circumstances press in like Paul's prison, where do you turn for confidence—and why does that source sometimes feel unsteady?
2. Reflect on a "good work" God has begun in your life. Why do you doubt He will complete it, and what fears hold you back?
3. In your closest relationships, how does your love (or lack of it) show up in prayer? Why might knowledge and discernment matter more than you first thought?
4. Picture crossing the "finish line" into Christ's presence. What unmet longings in your heart make this hope either thrilling or distant?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one specific "good work" God has started in you (from Philippians 1:6). Take a deliberate step to "work it out" daily—through prayer, obedience, or service—while noticing how God is already "working in you" (Philippians 2:12-13). Journal what you observe by week's end.
