# Dawn of Recognition: When the Risen Jesus Calls Your Name

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **John 20:1-18** and keep it in front of you throughout this study.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who was Mary Magdalene, and what role did she play in Jesus' life and death (search the Gospels for clues)?
2. Why might an early morning visit to the tomb have been significant in the cultural and historical setting of Jerusalem at Passover?
3. Consider the disciples' expectations after Jesus' crucifixion—what Old Testament prophecies or Jesus' own words (like Mark 9:31) might have shaped their confusion?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. Read John 20:1-18 slowly. List every detail about the tomb's condition, what Peter and John saw inside, and what they did next—what stands out as unusual or evidentiary?
2. Trace Mary's emotional journey in verses 11-18. What specific words or actions from Jesus cause her to shift from weeping to recognition?
3. Compare the empty tomb in John 20 with Jesus' predictions (e.g., Mark 9:31). What does this event reveal about His authority over death, especially when contrasted with other religious leaders' fates?
4. In verses 15-16, why do you think Mary didn't recognize Jesus at first? Examine the text for hints about tears, assumptions, or context—what blocks her sight?
5. Jesus tells Mary, "Do not cling to me" (v. 17). What larger truth about His resurrection mission emerges here, linking to His ascension and the disciples' future?
6. Cross-reference 1 Peter 1:3-4 and Romans 15:13. How do these connect the resurrection to a "living hope" amid trials—what qualities of this hope does the anchor text illustrate?
7. Notice Revelation 2:17. How does Jesus' personal call to "Mary" echo the promise of a new name—what does this suggest about His knowledge of us?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Journal your honest responses.
1. Why do preconceptions or shocks sometimes blind you to Jesus' presence in your own "empty tomb" moments?
2. When has God called you by name in a way that shifted your despair to joy—why did it take time to recognize Him?
3. What inherited hopes from this world compete with the "imperishable" inheritance of resurrection life in your heart right now?
4. Why might clinging to past experiences hinder your response to Jesus' current mission in your life?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one person in despair (a friend, family member, or stranger). Without explaining, simply speak their name while sharing a resurrection truth you discovered in John 20—then listen for how the living Jesus might speak through the moment.
