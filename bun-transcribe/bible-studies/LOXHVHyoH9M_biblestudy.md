# Humbled Thrones: Pride, Patience, and the Shadow of Judgment

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **2 Kings chapters 14-15** (New King James Version recommended). Keep **2 Chronicles 25** and **2 Chronicles 26** nearby for added details on Judah's kings.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Recall the division of Solomon's kingdom into Israel (north, 10 tribes, Samaria) and Judah (south, 2 tribes, Jerusalem). What clues in these chapters show how idolatry persisted in both, despite God's warnings?
2. God's patience shines through repeated evil reigns in Israel. Search nearby prophets or passages like **2 Peter 3:9** and **Ezekiel 18:23**—why does He delay judgment on rebellious nations?
3. Assyria looms as a threat (e.g., kings paying tribute). Look up Tiglath-Pileser III (called Pul here)—how does this empire's rise foreshadow Israel's unraveling?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observe the patterns in Judah's kings (Amaziah and Azariah/Uzziah):**
1. Read **2 Kings 14:3-4** and **2 Kings 15:1-5** alongside **2 Chronicles 25:14-15** and **2 Chronicles 26:16-21**. What victories do these kings claim, and what surprising actions follow that reveal their hearts?
2. Trace the phrase "like his father" or "did right... but." What remains unchanged in their reigns, and how does pride manifest in the temple incident (**2 Kings 15:5**)?

**Examine Israel's kings (Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and the rapid succession):**
3. In **2 Kings 14:15, 23-29** and **2 Kings 15**, list the lengths of reigns and how most end. What prophecy drives Jeroboam II's success (**2 Kings 14:25-27**), and why might God use an "evil" king for rescue?
4. Note the violence and tribute to Assyria (**2 Kings 15**). What cities fall under Pekah, and what repeated sins echo Jeroboam I?

**Interpret the big picture:**
5. Compare the proud downfalls in Judah with Israel's chaos. What connections emerge between personal pride, national idolatry, and consequences like breaches, leprosy, or assassinations?
6. Echoes appear in **Zechariah 14:5** and an earthquake. How do these kings' stories warn or point to larger judgments and hopes?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence with God. Journal your honest responses:
1. Where in your life does success or partial obedience mask hidden pride, much like these kings?
2. Why do you think God shows patience amid repeated rebellion—how does that mirror His pursuit of you right now?
3. When have you seen "reaping what is sown" in your choices, and what pulls you toward compromise with "enemies" like temptation?
4. What fears arise if your spiritual story doesn't "finish well"—and what unspoken doubts hold you back from full surrender?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one area where pride subtly rules (a victory you're clinging to, an unchanged "high place," or a compromise with an advancing threat). Humbly surrender it daily to God—confess it aloud, seek accountability from one trusted person, and watch for His humbling grace or hand at work.
