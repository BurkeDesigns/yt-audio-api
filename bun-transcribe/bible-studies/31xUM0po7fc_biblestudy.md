# The Thorn That Keeps You Close: Grace in the Grip of Pain

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **2 Corinthians 12:7-10** and keep it in front of you throughout this study.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read the opening of 2 Corinthians 12—what extraordinary experience had Paul just described, and how might it connect to a possible event in Acts 14?
2. Who was Paul writing to in Corinth, and why do you think they were questioning his authority as an apostle?
3. Consider Galatians 4 and Galatians 6:11—what clues do these give about Paul's physical struggles, and how might they relate to his time in Corinth?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What do you see in the text?**
1. In verse 7, what two descriptions does Paul give for the "thorn," who sent it, and what was its specific purpose?
2. How many times did Paul plead with the Lord (verses 8-9), and what exact words did God respond with?
3. List every category of hardship Paul mentions in verses 9-10 that he now chooses to "boast" in or "take pleasure" in— what power does he connect to them?

**Interpretation: What does it mean?**
4. Why do you think Paul describes the thorn with such strong language (consider the Greek word *skolops* if you look it up), yet keeps its exact nature vague—what might this teach about suffering in general?
5. When Paul shifts from pleading for removal to boasting in weakness, what change in perspective do you observe, and how does it link his trials to Christ's power?
6. Compare verse 10's "when I am weak, then I am strong"—how does this contrast with what the world (or even the Corinthians) might expect from a true apostle?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence before each question. Let the Holy Spirit search your heart.
1. What current "thorn" in your life—a physical pain, emotional wound, or ongoing opposition—feels like a messenger sent to torment you, and why does it persist despite your prayers?
2. In what ways might God be using your deepest weakness right now to guard against pride or self-reliance—how does that make you feel?
3. When have highs in your life (like a spiritual "vision") led to subtle exaltation of self, and how have lows drawn you nearer to Jesus?
4. Why do you resist taking pleasure in your hardships, and what would it look like to fully rely on Christ's power resting on you there?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, select one specific weakness or trial from your reflections above. Each day, whisper to God Paul's declaration from verse 9—"Your grace is sufficient for me"—and record one way His strength showed up in your weakness that day. Share it with one trusted friend by week's end.
