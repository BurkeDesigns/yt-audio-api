# Discovering God's Unshakable Truths: Wrestling with Life's Hard Questions

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **1 Kings 19** (a prophet's despair), **1 Corinthians 12-13** (spiritual gifts and love), **Philippians 4:6-7** (prayer amid anxiety), and **Revelation 20** (eternal destinies). Cross-reference other passages as prompted.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Look up Elijah's ministry in **1 Kings 18-19**. What massive confrontation preceded his breakdown, and how did Israel's spiritual climate contribute to his isolation?
2. Research the church at Corinth (**1 Corinthians**). What reports of division, immorality, and misuse of gifts reached Paul, making his letter so urgent?
3. Examine the Abrahamic promises (**Genesis 12** and **15**). In what historical covenant did God pledge land and blessing to Israel, and why might this clash with surrounding nations' views today?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Spiritual Influences and Thoughts**  
- Read **1 Kings 8:39** and **Psalm 139:4**. What unique attributes of God are highlighted regarding human hearts and words before they are spoken?  
- Based solely on these verses, what limits can you observe on any created being's knowledge?

**Purpose and Practice of Prayer**  
- Observe **Philippians 4:6-7** and **1 Peter 5:7**. What specific actions does Scripture command in place of anxious striving, and what outcome is described?  
- How do these texts portray prayer's effect on the mind and heart?

**Depression and Despair**  
- In **1 Kings 19**, catalog Elijah's physical actions, emotional pleas, and God's step-by-step responses. What surprises you about God's care in crisis?  
- Trace the sequence: What refreshed Elijah before God addressed his deeper complaints?

**Spiritual Gifts**  
- Scan **1 Corinthians 12:7**, **12:11**, and **13:8-13**. To whom and for what purpose are gifts distributed?  
- What enduring quality outlasts all gifts, and why?

**Baptism's Role**  
- Compare **Titus 3:5-7** with **Acts 2:38** and **Acts 10**. What regenerates and saves according to these? Where does baptism fit in the flow?  
- Note examples like Cornelius (**Acts 10**): What happened before baptism?

**Forgiveness and Accusation**  
- Examine **Psalm 103:12** and **Romans 8:1**. How far does God remove sin, and what stands against condemnation for believers?

**Israel's Future**  
- Connect **Genesis 12**, **Genesis 15:18**, **Romans 11:25-26**, **Zechariah 12**, and **Zechariah 13**. What unbreakable elements mark God's dealings with Israel?

**Eternal Realities**  
- Align **Matthew 25:46**, **Revelation 20:10**, **20:14-15**, and **Luke 16**. How does the Bible describe the duration and inhabitants of final punishment?  
- What choice leads there, per these texts?

**True Faith vs. Self-Deception**  
- In **Matthew 7:21-23** and **Romans 10:9-10**, what distinguishes those who enter the kingdom from those turned away?

## Deep Reflection
Pause for silence and honest heart-searching:  
1. What fears or doubts keep you from fully casting your cares on God right now?  
2. In your own "wilderness" seasons of dryness or silence from God, what might He be inviting you to remember or release?  
3. Why do you think submitting your will to God's brings true peace amid life's chaos?  
4. How does eternity's clarity challenge the way you handle unforgiveness or toxic influences today?

## The Challenge (Application)
Identify one personal question or struggle surfaced in this study (like anxiety, unforgiveness, or seeking God's will). For the next seven days, prayerfully apply the discovered principle from Scripture – live it out in a specific situation – then share your observations with a trusted believer.
