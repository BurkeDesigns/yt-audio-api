# Torn Between Two Worlds: Earth or Eternity?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Philippians 1:19-25** and keep it there as your primary guide. Have these supporting passages nearby: **Philippians 1:6**, **Philippians 1:21**, **Acts 23**, and **Revelation 21**.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read **Acts 23**. What events led Paul to a Roman prison around AD 62? How might God's involvement in those circumstances shape his words in Philippians 1?
2. Who was the original audience in Philippi? Why might Paul's message from prison have felt so counter-cultural to them?
3. Look up **Psalm 103:19** and **1 Kings 8:30**. What do these reveal about where God rules and dwells, influencing Paul's perspective on life and death?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
Spend time reading and re-reading **Philippians 1:19-25** slowly. Mark key phrases, repeated ideas, and contrasts. Then explore these:
1. In verses 19-20, what bold expectation does Paul express about his imprisonment? What reasons from the text give him this confidence?
2. Scan verse 21. What two outcomes does Paul weigh, and how does he describe each one? What tension do you observe in his desires?
3. Verses 22-25 show Paul's dilemma—staying or departing. Based on the text, what factors pull him toward fruitful labor on earth, and what draws him to be "with Christ"?
4. Earlier in the letter (**Philippians 1:6**), Paul mentions God completing His work. How does this connect to Paul's chains and circumstances here? What does the text suggest about God's purposes in trials?
5. Turn to **Revelation 21** (verses 1, 18, 21, 23, 27) and **Revelation 22:1**. What vivid details describe the heavenly city? How might these contrast with Paul's earthly prison, and link to his view of death as "gain" (**2 Corinthians 5:6-8**; **2 Corinthians 12:1-2**)?
6. Notice **Matthew 17** and **1 Corinthians 13**. What do these add to your understanding of recognition and relationships in eternity? How does this relate to Paul's longing?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause here for silence. Let these questions stir your soul:
1. Why do the things of this world hold you back from fully embracing "to live is Christ"?
2. What fears or attachments make "to die is gain" feel distant or unappealing right now?
3. In what areas of your life are you torn between earthly progress and eternal priorities?
4. If heaven were your true home, how would that change your daily longings today?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, choose one relationship or responsibility where you're tempted to prioritize your own comfort. Intentionally reframe it with Paul's words: "For to me, to live is Christ." Act on it by serving selflessly, then journal what "gain" you discover—on earth or beyond.
