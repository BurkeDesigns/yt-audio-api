# Are You the Watchman God Is Calling?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Ezekiel 33**. Read the entire chapter slowly before answering any questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. What was the role of a watchman in ancient Israelite cities? Search references like **2 Samuel** for city gates and **2 Kings** for lookout towers—how did this prepare the way for Ezekiel's assignment?
2. Scan **Ezekiel 1-32** briefly; then note the major shift starting in Ezekiel 33—what clues in the text suggest a change from judgment to something else?
3. Who was Ezekiel speaking to, and why might his message have felt urgent? Consider Israel's situation during this time.

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
### Observation: What Do You See?
1. In Ezekiel 33:1-9, list every action a watchman must take when danger approaches. What happens if he warns—or fails to warn?
2. Examine Ezekiel 33:7-9 closely: Who appoints the watchman, and what is his sole responsibility? What phrase repeats about the consequences for the hearer?
3. In Ezekiel 33:10-11, what do the people say about their situation? How does God immediately respond, and what two outcomes does He contrast?
4. Track the word "turn" across Ezekiel 33:11-16—what conditions does God set for the righteous who sin and the wicked who change? What promise does He give about remembering sins?

### Interpretation: What Does It Mean?
1. Based on Ezekiel 33:1-9, whose job is it to change hearts—the watchman's or God's? How does this free the watchman?
2. Compare Ezekiel 33:11 with **2 Peter 3:9**—what do both reveal about God's deepest desire for people?
3. How do **Matthew 5:13-16** describe believers' role in the world? In what ways might this echo the watchman's duties to warn, preserve, expose, and guide?
4. Ponder **Colossians 1:28** alongside Ezekiel 33:10-16—what goal unites warning about sin with proclaiming Christ? Consider **Isaiah 43:25**, **Micah 7:19**, and **Psalm 103:8-12**—how do these illuminate God's fairness in judgment and forgiveness?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Sit in silence with God and journal your honest responses:
1. Why might I hesitate to warn others about sin's consequences, even when I see the danger?
2. Where in my life have I ignored a warning from God—what "turning" feels impossible right now, and why?
3. How does God's patience with the rebellious stir something in my heart toward those I find hard to love?
4. If God remembers my repented sins no more, why do I still carry shame—what truth from His Word can I claim today?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one person in your life who needs a gentle warning about sin's path, paired with an invitation to Christ's grace. Obey by speaking it clearly, then release the outcome to God—journal what happens without trying to control the response.
