# Revolutionary Submission: God's Design for Thriving Relationships

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Ephesians 5:20-6:9**. Read the entire passage slowly before answering any questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who wrote this letter, and what was his situation when he wrote it? How might that shape his words on relationships?
2. What do you know about the city of Ephesus and its culture? Why might instructions on marriage, parenting, and work have been especially bold or counter-cultural there?
3. Look up the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:12). How does its promise connect to the family instructions in Ephesians 6?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Foundational Posture (Ephesians 5:20-21)**  
1. What attitude toward God is linked to "submitting to one another"? List any reasons or motivations given.  
2. Notice how verses 20-21 connect to what follows. What "fear" motivates mutual submission?  

**Marriage (Ephesians 5:22-33)**  
3. In verses 22-24, what specific action are wives urged toward, and to what ultimate authority is it likened? Observe the word used for "submit" (look it up in a lexicon if possible).  
4. Count the verses addressed to husbands (25-33). What repeated command dominates, and how is Christ's love for the church described (list the actions or qualities)?  
5. Scan verses 25-30: What does it mean for a husband to "know" his wife (cross-reference 1 Peter 3:7)? How is oneness pictured?  
6. In verse 33, what one-word summary captures the wife's response to her husband? How does the passage tie every role back to the Lord?  

**Family (Ephesians 6:1-4)**  
7. What two actions are children commanded toward parents, and what qualification is added ("in the Lord")? Note the promise attached to one of them.  
8. For fathers (or parents) in verse 4, what warning is given, and what positive alternatives are urged? What kind of training is specified?  

**Workplace (Ephesians 6:5-9)**  
9. How are bondservants (employees) told to relate to earthly masters? List the qualities of their service (e.g., attitude, motivation). What rewards are mentioned regardless of earthly status?  
10. For masters (employers), what instructions mirror or contrast the servants'? Why does God show "no partiality"?  
11. Throughout 5:20-6:9, trace every phrase like "in the Lord," "as to the Lord," or "as unto Christ." What priority do they establish in all relationships? When might obedience to humans be refused?  

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Journal your honest responses.  
1. In what relationship (marriage, family, work) do I most resist submission or sacrificial love—and why?  
2. Where has selfishness or pride shown up in my roles this week? What fear of God (or lack of it) might be at the root?  
3. How does my gratitude to God influence how I treat others? Where am I treating people more like "bosses" than as unto the Lord?  
4. If Jesus is my ultimate model, what one area of my heart needs His transforming grace right now—and why have I delayed it?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, prayerfully identify **one specific relationship** (marriage, family, or work) where the phrase "as to the Lord" applies. Choose **one actionable step** straight from the text—submit respectfully, love sacrificially, obey sincerely, or train with grace—and carry it out daily, tracking in a journal how it honors God and impacts harmony.
