# Downtime Dangers: When Giants Lurk and Pride Counts the Cost

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **1 Chronicles 20:4-8** and **1 Chronicles 21:1-30**. Keep **2 Samuel 21:15-22** and **2 Samuel 24** nearby for comparison.

## Contextual Investigation
- Trace the origins of the "giants" (Rephaim) mentioned in 1 Chronicles 20:4-8. Check Genesis 6, Genesis 14:5, Deuteronomy 3:11—what ongoing battles do these reveal across Israel's history?
- Compare 1 Chronicles 20 with 2 Samuel 11. What was the setting in David's life during these events, and how does it connect to the warnings in Job 1?
- Note the location of Ornan's threshing floor in 1 Chronicles 21 (see 2 Chronicles 3:1 and Genesis 22). Why might God pause His judgment there?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation:**
- In 1 Chronicles 20:4-8 (and parallel in 2 Samuel 21:15-22), list the specific giants defeated, who killed each one, and any unique details about their weapons or features. Who is *not* leading these victories?
- Scan 1 Chronicles 21:1-7. What prompts David's command? Observe Joab's response and what he leaves out of the count. What are the totals reported?
- Track the sequence in 1 Chronicles 21:8-17: David's reaction to God's displeasure, the three options from Gad, David's choice, the plague's toll, and his plea for the people.

**Interpretation:**
- Based on 1 Chronicles 20:4-8, what role do David's mighty men play when he steps back? How does this contrast with earlier stories of giants like Goliath?
- In 1 Chronicles 21:1-7 (compare 2 Samuel 24:1), what might David's census reveal about his heart? Why does Joab resist, and what does the omission of tribes suggest?
- Examine 1 Chronicles 21:8-30: the angel's halt, David's intercession ("these sheep, what have they done?"), the purchase price, and the sacrifices. What shifts occur in response to David's actions?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Sit in silence with your Bible open and journal your responses:
- When have quiet seasons or successes in your life opened doors to temptation? Why do you suspect those moments feel vulnerable?
- Recall a time pride led you to "count" your strengths or resources. What distance did it create between you and God or others—and why did it linger?
- Facing consequences of your choices, whose fault have you been quickest to assign? Why does taking full ownership feel so hard?
- Picture God offering mercy amid judgment. What in your current struggles makes His hand feel both just and compassionate?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one area of "downtime pride" (a self-reliant habit or unconfessed sin) from your reflections. Confess it openly to God and one trusted believer, then together offer a specific act of sacrifice—like serving someone in need at personal cost—watching for God's sheathed sword of mercy.
