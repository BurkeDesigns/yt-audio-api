# Caught in a Blink: What Does Scripture Reveal About the Sudden Change?

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to these passages as you study:  
**1 Corinthians 15:50-57**  
**1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11**

## Contextual Investigation
1. Read 1 Corinthians 15:1-49 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13. What were the believers in Corinth and Thessalonica worried or confused about regarding death, resurrection, and Christ's return?  
2. Look up Acts 18:1-17 and Acts 17:1-9. Why might Paul's words about a "mystery" and being "caught up" have been especially urgent and hopeful for these new churches facing persecution?  
3. Search Deuteronomy 29:29 and 1 Corinthians 4:1. What does this teach about the role of God's servants like Paul in revealing hidden truths?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In 1 Corinthians 15:50-52, what problem does Paul identify about entering God's kingdom, and what sudden "mystery" event does he describe as the solution? List the sequence of events step by step.  
2. Compare 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 with 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. Who exactly participates in this event (the dead and the living)? Where does it happen, and what change occurs to their bodies?  
3. What Greek word for "trumpet" or "moment" stands out in 1 Corinthians 15:52 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16? How does this emphasize the timing—consider Matthew 24:36 and what only the Father knows.  
4. Examine 1 Thessalonians 1:10 and 5:9 alongside 1 Corinthians 15:54-57. Why does this event happen for believers? What contrasts does Paul draw between death, victory, and God's wrath?  
5. In 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11, what commands does Paul give for daily living in light of this imminent event? How does he describe the posture believers should have (e.g., sober, armored)?  
6. Trace the word "mystery" across Romans 11:25, Ephesians 1:9 and 3:1-12, and Colossians 1:25-2:3. What pattern emerges about things once hidden but now made known through Christ?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence before each question. Journal your honest thoughts.  
1. Why, in your own life right now, might the idea of Christ's return "in a moment" feel either exciting or unsettling?  
2. What distractions or "sleep" in your heart could leave you unprepared if this event happened today?  
3. Why do you think God calls believers to encourage and build each other up amid uncertainty about the future?  
4. Reflecting on victory over death in 1 Corinthians 15:57, what personal "sting" of death or fear are you carrying, and why hasn't gratitude changed it yet?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, live out 1 Thessalonians 5:6-11 by identifying one specific way you've been spiritually "asleep" or lazy (e.g., in discernment, prayer, or relationships). Take a concrete step to "stay alert and sober," such as putting on one piece of the armor of God daily through prayer, and use it to intentionally encourage another believer facing trials—report back to them (or a group) how it prepared your heart for Christ's any-moment return.
