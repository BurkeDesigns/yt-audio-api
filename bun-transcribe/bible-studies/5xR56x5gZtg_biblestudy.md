# Unveiled Glory: Conformity or Kingdom Transformation?

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Mark 9:1-8**. Read it slowly several times before answering any questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. What key events and conversations happen in Mark 8 immediately before Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up the mountain? How might these set the stage for what unfolds?
2. Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus—who do they represent in Israel's history, and why might their presence be significant here?
3. Read 2 Peter 1:16-18. How does Peter later connect this mountain experience to the reliability of God's prophetic word?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In verses 1-2, what bold promise does Jesus make about the kingdom of God, and who does He invite to witness something extraordinary?
2. Describe the dramatic change in Jesus' appearance in verses 2-3. What words capture His transformation, and how does this differ from His everyday form?
3. Who else appears with Jesus in verse 4, and what are they discussing? What might this reveal about the kingdom's connection to God's past promises?
4. In verses 5-7, how does Peter respond, and what interrupts him from the cloud? What single command does the voice give, and to whom is it directed?
5. Read Romans 12:2. What two pressures are contrasted— one from "this age" and one from God? How does the mind's renewal play a role?
6. Look at Hebrews 4:12. What does God's word do to the deepest parts of a person, and how might this equip someone facing external pressures?
7. In 2 Corinthians 3:18, what ongoing process happens as we behold the Lord? Who provides the power for this change "from glory to glory"?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Let the Holy Spirit search your heart.
1. Where in your daily life—at home, work, or community—are you sensing pressure to conform to the world's patterns, and why does it feel so strong?
2. When you think of Jesus' radiant glory on the mountain, what hidden areas of your heart resist surrendering to His transforming presence, and why?
3. How has the Word or Spirit begun (or failed to begin) changing you from the inside out, and what fears hold you back from deeper obedience?
4. If the kingdom's power is present now through Jesus, why do your values and behaviors sometimes still reflect the age around you instead?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify **one specific area** where cultural pressure is squeezing you to conform (like Play-Doh under external force). Each day, counter it by reading Romans 12:2 aloud, then prayerfully asking the Spirit to renew your mind with a truth from Mark 9:1-8. Journal one observable change by week's end.
