# Shouts from the Storm: What Makes Gratitude Unstoppable?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Psalm 100**. Keep these passages nearby for reference: **Acts 26:17-18**, **1 John 4:16-19**, **Romans 10:9**, and **Romans 5:8**.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Investigate the setting of Psalm 100. Who might have used it in ancient Israel, and what larger biblical practices surround it?
2. Turn to Acts 26. Who is Paul addressing in this moment, and what personal story leads into verses 17-18?
3. Explore 1 John 4. What challenges was the early church facing that make verses 16-19 stand out?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)

### Observation: What Do You See?
1. Read Psalm 100 slowly. List every command to act or respond—what sounds, entrances, and attitudes does it demand?
2. Scan Acts 26:17-18. What specific actions does Jesus say He will take to deliver Paul, and what results does He promise for others?
3. Note the sequence in 1 John 4:16-19. What connections does it draw between knowing God, experiencing love, and our own loving?
4. Observe Romans 10:9 and Romans 5:8 side by side. What simple action leads to salvation, and how is God's love demonstrated right before we respond?

### Interpretation: What Does It Mean?
1. In Psalm 100:3-5, what unchangeable truths about God fuel the shouts and songs—especially amid uncertainty?
2. Based on Acts 26:17-18, how does God describe the shift from darkness to light, and why might He choose unlikely people for this mission?
3. From 1 John 4:16-19, what source powers perfect love, and how does fear factor into experiencing it fully?
4. Weigh Romans 5:8 against Romans 10:9. When and how does God prove His love most dramatically, and what confession unlocks its power in a life?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence before each question. Let the Holy Spirit search your heart.
1. Why do trials in your life spark complaints more than shouts— what truth from Psalm 100 might change that?
2. Where in your story do you see echoes of Acts 26:17-18's darkness-to-light turnaround, and why have you hesitated to step into it fully?
3. Reflecting on 1 John 4:16-19, why does fear still grip areas of your life despite God's love—what unmet need keeps it there?
4. Considering Romans 5:8 and 10:9, why might confessing Jesus aloud feel risky right now—what holds your tongue?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, choose one person facing a storm (health, family, or loss). Share with them one observed truth from these Scriptures about God's intervention or love, then invite them to confess it aloud in prayer together—watch and journal what God does.
