# The Grace That Gives: What Does Your Heart Sow?

**The Anchor Text**  
Have your Bible open to *2 Corinthians 8-9*. Read the full chapters slowly before answering any questions.

**Contextual Investigation**  
1. Look up the background of the church in Corinth—who planted it, and what made their cultural context unique compared to other churches Paul wrote to?  
2. Investigate the situation of the believers in Jerusalem: Why were they destitute, and why might it have been challenging for a Gentile church like Corinth to help them?  
3. Who was Titus, and what role does he (and possibly others) play in this passage regarding the collection?

**Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)**  
*Observation*: What stands out in the text?  
1. In 2 Corinthians 8:1-7, what examples does Paul point to about giving, and how does he connect it to other qualities like faith, speech, knowledge, and love?  
2. Scan 2 Corinthians 8:8 and 9:5—what distinction does Paul make between giving as a commandment and something else?  
3. In 2 Corinthians 9:6-8, what pattern does Paul describe regarding the sower, the harvest, and God's supply—what specific outcomes does he mention?  
4. Notice 2 Corinthians 9:7—what words does Paul use to describe the giver's heart, and what does God specifically love or test?  
5. Read 2 Corinthians 9:10-11 and 15—how does Paul describe God's ongoing provision, and to what ultimate purpose?  

*Interpretation*: What does this reveal about God, people, and giving?  
6. Based on these chapters, how does generous giving function as a revealer of deeper spiritual realities?  
7. According to the text, what motivates giving that goes beyond duty, and how does God respond to it?  
8. What do verses like 2 Corinthians 9:8 and 11 imply about God's ability and intention toward those who give generously?

**Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)**  
Pause in silence with God. Journal your honest responses.  
1. Why do you think your current approach to money and giving might reveal more about your heart than you realize?  
2. In what areas of your life does giving feel like a "commandment" rather than grace—what might that say about your relationship with God?  
3. When you give (or withhold), what emotions arise in your heart, and why do you suspect God weighs them so carefully?  
4. How might God's promise of abundance challenge your fears about scarcity right now?

**The Challenge (Application)**  
This week, prayerfully select one specific opportunity to give generously—perhaps to a need in your church family or community—and do so with a heart focused on grace, not obligation. Afterward, return to 2 Corinthians 9:7 and note what God reveals to you about your heart through the experience.
