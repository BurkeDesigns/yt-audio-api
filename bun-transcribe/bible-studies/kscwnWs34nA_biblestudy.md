# Humbled King, Unstoppable Kingdom: David's Awe and God's Triumphs

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **1 Chronicles 17:15-27; 18:1-20:3**. Keep these chapters in front of you as you explore.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Investigate the background of 1 Chronicles: Who wrote it, and to whom was it likely addressed? How does this shape the way David's story is told here?
2. Research the city of Gath and its connection to David's past (consider 1 Samuel). Why might defeating the Philistines there carry special weight after 20 years?
3. Look up the promised land borders in Genesis 15:18. What nations does David confront in chapter 18, and how do these victories align with that ancient promise?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What stands out in the text?**
1. In 17:15-27, list every question David asks about himself, his house, and God. What repeated words or phrases highlight his posture before God?
2. Scan chapters 18-20: Who are the key enemies David defeats, and what specific items or territories does he gain? Note any connections to future temple-building.
3. In chapter 19, trace the sequence from David's initial act of kindness to the battle. What do Joab and Abishai say to each other before fighting, and how do they organize their forces?
4. Observe the leaders listed in 18:14-17. What roles do David's relatives (like Joab and Abishai) play, and where does David position himself?

**Interpretation: What does this reveal about God and His ways?**
1. Based on David's prayer in 17:16-27, what does he say about God's past actions toward Israel and His future intentions for David's line?
2. In the victories of chapters 18-20, what outcomes follow Israel's battles? How do the enemies respond, and what does this suggest about God's involvement?
3. Consider the misstep in 20:1 where David stays in Jerusalem during the spring campaign. Cross-reference 2 Samuel 11—what pattern emerges about idleness amid success?
4. Joab's words in 19:13 encourage mutual strength and trust in God. What broader principle about facing opposition might this illustrate?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:
1. When have you echoed David's "Who am I?" in light of God's kindness—why does awe like this feel distant in your life right now?
2. Reflect on a "stolen territory" in your own story (a relationship, calling, or joy). Why do you think God sometimes allows enemies to press in before victory?
3. Where might idleness or ease be setting you up for a stumble? What unmet longing in your heart draws you toward comfort over courage?
4. Imagine standing with a fellow believer in battle, as Joab did. Why haven't you spoken words of mutual encouragement lately—what holds you back?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one area where the enemy seems to have gained ground in your life (a fear, habit, or lost ground). Humbly pray David's prayer of awe over it—claiming God's covenant faithfulness—then reach out to one trusted ally, sharing the battle and committing to "be strong" together as you resist.
