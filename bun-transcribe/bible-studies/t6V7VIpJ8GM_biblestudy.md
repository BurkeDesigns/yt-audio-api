# One in Christ: United Despite Our Differences

## The Anchor Text
**Galatians 3:26-29**  
*(Keep this passage open in your Bible as you work through the study.)*

## Contextual Investigation
1. Research the social structure of the Roman Empire in the first century: What roles did slaves play, and how common was slavery? How does this relate to Paul's words?
2. Look up first-century Jewish customs and prayers: Why might some Jews have thanked God for not making them a Gentile, slave, or woman? How does this backdrop make Paul's message stand out?
3. Examine the setting of the Galatian churches: What pressures from "Judaizers" were influencing new believers there, and how does that shape Paul's emphasis on unity?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
### Observation: What Do You See?
1. List the three pairs of distinctions Paul mentions in Galatians 3:28. What words does he use to describe the oneness of all believers?
2. Read Galatians 3:26-27: What action unites everyone as children of God, regardless of background?
3. Scan supporting passages like Colossians 3:11, Acts 10:34-35, and Revelation 5:9: What common themes emerge about diversity in God's family?

### Interpretation: What Does It Mean?
1. In Galatians 3:28, what *does not* change about ethnic (Jew/Gentile), socioeconomic (slave/free), or biological (male/female) differences, based on cross-references like Romans 2, Ephesians 6:5-8, Ephesians 5, 1 Timothy 2, and Titus 2?
2. How do passages like Galatians 1:10, 1 Timothy 1:10, and Acts 26 clarify that equality in Christ does not erase accountability or distinct roles?
3. Consider "one another" commands in Philippians 2:3, John 13:35, Romans 15:7, and Ephesians 4:32: What responsibilities do believers have toward each other in light of their equal standing?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:
1. Where in your life do differences (yours or others') create division or prejudice—why does that happen in your heart?
2. How has culture's view of unity (blurring differences or weaponizing them) influenced your relationships in the church— what fears or comforts drive that?
3. When have you welcomed someone as Christ has welcomed you, and when have you tolerated what grieves God—why the difference?
4. What would change if you truly saw every believer as co-heir with Christ—how does that expose pride or favoritism in you?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one person in your church family who differs from you (ethnically, socioeconomically, or by gender roles). Intentionally esteem them as superior to yourself (Philippians 2:3), serving them in love without demanding they change—observe what God reveals about unity in your heart.
