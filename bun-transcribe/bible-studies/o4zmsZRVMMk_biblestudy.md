# From Sheepfold to Forever Throne: What House Is God Really Building?

**The Anchor Text**  
Have your Bible open to **1 Chronicles 16:8-36** and **1 Chronicles 17:1-14** as you work through this guide.

**Contextual Investigation**  
- What key events led up to David bringing the Ark to Jerusalem, and how does this setting make his words and actions stand out?  
- Investigate the roles of places like Gibeon and people like Asaph, Obed-Edom, and Zadok—why were these worship arrangements significant in Israel's story?  
- Trace the thread of God's promises through Israel's history up to David; what patterns emerge about how God initiates His plans?

**Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)**  

*Observation: What do you see repeated or emphasized?*  
- In 1 Chronicles 16:20-22, 23-33, and 34-36, list the specific actions or attributes ascribed to God—what details stand out about His dealings with people and creation?  
- Note the assignments given to Asaph, the gatekeepers, priests at Gibeon, and musicians—what does this reveal about ongoing worship?  
- In 1 Chronicles 17:1-14, contrast David's surroundings and desires with the Ark's current setup; what surprising shift happens through Nathan?  

*Interpretation: What does this mean in the passage?*  
- Based on verses like 1 Chronicles 16:23-33 and 17:7-14, how does God describe His past involvement with David and Israel—what larger purpose might this point to?  
- Examine the promises in 1 Chronicles 17:10-14 about David's "house," throne, and kingdom—how do words like "forever" challenge human expectations?  
- Compare the tone of thanks and "Amen" in 1 Chronicles 16:34-36 with the prophecy of judgment; what tensions or harmonies do you observe about God's character?

**Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)**  
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:  
- Why might I, like David, want to build something grand for God right now—what unmet desire in my heart is driving that?  
- In what areas of my life have I overlooked God's past rescues or provisions, and why does that happen?  
- How does the idea of an "unshakable throne" stir hope or resistance in me today?  
- What would it look like if I truly echoed the psalm's call to declare God's works—why haven't I done so more?

**The Discovery Challenge (Application)**  
This week, identify one situation where you're tempted to "build the house" for God on your terms. Instead, pause daily to recount three specific ways He's built or protected you so far, then surrender that situation with an "Amen"—and watch for His unexpected move.
