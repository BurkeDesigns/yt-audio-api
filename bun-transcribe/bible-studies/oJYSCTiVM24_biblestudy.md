# Revival to Ruin: Where Is God's Hand in a Nation's Collapse?

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **2 Kings 23-25** as you work through this guide. Read the full passages slowly before answering any questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who was Josiah, and what key discovery sparked his reforms (see 2 Kings 22 for background)? How does his family line and the surrounding empires (Assyria, Egypt, Babylon) set the stage for these chapters?
2. Research the timeline of Babylonian ascendance around 605-586 BC. What roles did Pharaoh Neco and Nebuchadnezzar play in Judah's politics, and why might God allow foreign kings to dominate His people?
3. Trace the three major deportations to Babylon (including key figures like Daniel and Ezekiel). What does this reveal about God's strategy during national judgment?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What do you see in the text?**
1. Scan 2 Kings 23:1-30. List every specific action Josiah took against idols and high places. What thoroughness do you notice in his reforms, especially with physical objects?
2. In 2 Kings 23:31–24:20, chart the four kings who followed Josiah: their ages, reign lengths, origins (including name changes), alliances, taxes, rebellions, and the phrase repeated about their character. What patterns emerge in their leadership?
3. Observe the details of Jerusalem's fall in 2 Kings 25:1-21. Note the siege length, Zedekiah's fate, the temple's destruction, items looted, executions, and what happened to the poorest people and leaders.
4. Who does God raise up amid the deportations (consider Daniel in the first, Ezekiel in the second)? How does 2 Kings 24:1-7 and 25:22-30 hint at God's control over invaders and even a final act of honor for Jehoiachin?

**Interpretation: What does it mean?**
1. Based on Josiah's death in 2 Kings 23:29-30, what caution might the text imply about entering conflicts? Contrast this with his earlier godly pursuits.
2. Why do you think God used Babylon, raiders from surrounding nations, and famine/cannibalism as tools of discipline (see 2 Kings 24:2-4, especially references to Manasseh and innocent blood)?
3. In the midst of total ruin, what evidence of God's providence do you spot—both in judgment and in positioning prophets or showing unexpected mercy (2 Kings 25:27-30)?
4. Compare Josiah's complete destruction of idols (ground to powder) with the half-hearted responses of later kings. What does this suggest about dealing with sin?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Journal your honest responses.
1. Where in your own life or community do you see echoes of idolatry or "innocent blood" that God might be disciplining? Why do you resist fully confronting it?
2. Reflect on battles or rebellions you've pursued without clear guidance from God. What fears or desires drive you into them?
3. How has God's "unseen hand" shown up in your past crises, even when miracles were absent? Why do you struggle to trust it now?
4. Amid your current trials, where do you long for God's mercy to break through justice? What holds you back from expecting it?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one persistent sin or idol in your life that you've only set aside but not fully destroyed. Take radical, thorough action to eliminate it completely—like grinding it to powder—while seeking God's guidance to avoid unauthorized "battles." Track how His providence unfolds as you obey.
