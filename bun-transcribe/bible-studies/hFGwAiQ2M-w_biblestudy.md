# Wise Men Still Seek Him: What Draws Outsiders to Worship?

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Matthew 2:1-12** and keep it in front of you throughout this study.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Who were the "Magi" historically? Search references like Daniel 5:11 and explore their role in ancient Persia or Babylon—why might these outsiders be watching the stars for a king's birth?
2. Consider the timeline: After the shepherds' visit, Jesus is in a house (not a manger), and Herod targets boys up to 2 years old. How does this setting make the Magi's journey more remarkable?
3. Look up Micah 5—how does this prophecy about Bethlehem shape the urgency of the Magi's search in a hostile political environment?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
### Observation: What Do You See?
1. Read Matthew 2:1-12 slowly three times. List every detail about the Magi's origin, their actions upon arrival, and how they respond when they find Jesus.
2. Track the star's movements: Where does it first appear? Where does it lead them next? Note their emotional response when it reappears.
3. Examine the three gifts in verse 11—what do they bring, how do they present them, and what is Jesus doing when they arrive?

### Interpretation: What Does It Mean?
1. Based on verses 1-2 and 11, what title do the Magi give Jesus, and how does their worship differ from Herod's reaction in verses 3-8?
2. Verses 9-10 describe guidance and great joy—what might "His star" reveal about how God draws unlikely seekers from afar?
3. The gifts echo ancient practices and prophecies like Isaiah 60:6—compare them: What aspects of Jesus' identity (king? priest? something more?) do these specific items point to in the text?
4. Contrast the Magi's question in verse 2 with Genesis 3:9—what reversal do you observe in who is seeking whom?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Journal your honest thoughts.
1. Why, in your own life right now, might Jesus feel more like a distant star than a King worthy of your full worship?
2. Where do you resist letting Jesus intercede as your Priest—perhaps in weaknesses or temptations you're hiding from Him?
3. What "Herod-like" fears keep you from laying down your most precious "gifts" at Jesus' feet?
4. If Jesus is both your Sacrifice and your King, why do certain sins or areas of control still grip you?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, select one gift symbol (gold for kingship, frankincense for priesthood, or myrrh for sacrifice) that challenges you most from Matthew 2:11. Identify a specific situation where you've withheld it from Jesus, then take one bold, measurable step to offer it—live it out daily and note what God reveals.
