# Dead or Alive? Uncovering God's Power to Revive

**The Anchor Text**  
Have your Bible open to *Ephesians 2:1-10*. Read it slowly several times before answering the questions below.

**Contextual Investigation**  
1. Who wrote this letter, under what circumstances, and to which group of people? How might Paul's own life story influence his words here?  
2. Look up the city of Ephesus in Acts 19—what spiritual battles were happening there, and why might a message about being "made alive" stand out?  
3. Scan the whole book of Ephesians—how does this chapter fit into Paul's bigger emphasis on God's cosmic victory?

**Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)**  
*Observation: What stands out in the text?*  
1. In verses 1-3, what vivid words or phrases does Paul use to describe humanity's starting point? List every influence he mentions that keeps people in that state.  
2. Verses 4-6 shift dramatically—what three key attributes of God break through in these verses? How does Paul describe our new position "in Christ"?  
3. Trace verses 8-10: What role do "faith," "grace," and "works" play? What does Paul say about where good works come from?  

*Interpretation: What does it mean?*  
4. Compare verses 1-3 with cross-references like Romans 12:2, James 4:7, and Galatians 5:19-21—which "forces" pull toward death, and how does Ephesians 2 portray the devil's role specifically?  
5. In verses 4-7, how do mercy, love, and grace differ in action (see also Psalm 103:8,10; Jeremiah 31:3; Romans 5:8)? Why does Paul call them "rich," "great," and "exceeding"?  
6. Reflect on the glove-and-hand illustration in light of verse 10: Without God's life in us, what happens to human effort? How does being "raised up" change our purpose?

**Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)**  
Pause in silence after each question. Journal your honest responses.  
1. Why might it be easier to feel physically alive but spiritually numb in your daily routines—what evidence from your life matches verses 1-3?  
2. When have mercy, love, or grace felt unearned in your story—why do you resist yielding to them fully?  
3. What fears arise if your identity shifts from self-effort to Christ's finished work—how does that expose hidden "forces against" you?  
4. In what ways are you still living from a "dead" mindset—why hasn't God's revival fully reshaped your thoughts and choices yet?

**The Discovery Challenge (Application)**  
This week, identify one specific "good work" God prepared beforehand for you (Ephesians 2:10)—not from your strength, but flowing from grace. Pursue it daily, then journal at week's end: How did relying on His life in you (not your own) transform the outcome and your heart?
