# Who Is Like You, O LORD? Uncovering His Matchless Deeds

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Exodus 15:1-11** and **Psalm 100**. Read these passages slowly several times before answering the questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Scan Exodus 14. What desperate crisis had God just dramatically resolved for His people, setting the stage for the song in chapter 15?
2. In the ancient Near East, people often praised many gods. What bold claim in Exodus 15:11 challenges that worldview?
3. Consider the superscription and structure of Psalm 100. What kind of gathering or occasion might this psalm have originally accompanied?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation**  
- In Exodus 15:1-11, list every action or quality attributed to God or His deeds—what verbs and images stand out?  
- What repeated commands or calls to action appear in Psalm 100, and who is being addressed?  
- Note any connections between God's past deliverance in Exodus 15 and the reasons for joy in Psalm 100.  

**Interpretation**  
- Based on Exodus 15:4-10, what specific ways does God demonstrate His power and uniqueness over all rivals?  
- Why does Exodus 15:11 shift from describing God's actions to asking "Who is like You"? How might this question guide how we recount His works today?  
- In Psalm 100:3 and 5, what truths about God's character form the foundation for serving and thanksgiving—how do they endure despite changing circumstances?  
- How do the responses in both passages (shouting, singing, serving) reflect a shift from fear to mission—what "deeds" fuel this?

## Deep Reflection
Sit in silence with God and journal your honest responses:  
1. When have you witnessed God's "matchless" deeds in your life or community—why do you hesitate to proclaim them like in Exodus 15?  
2. What keeps gratitude or service from being "glad" in your heart right now, as Psalm 100 urges?  
3. In what areas of your life are you praising your own efforts instead of His enduring faithfulness?  
4. How might unchanging truths about God's goodness reshape your view of service, outreach, or growth amid uncertainty?

## The Discovery Challenge
This week, identify one specific "deed" of God in your personal life, family, or church community (like deliverance, provision, or fruitfulness). Proclaim it publicly—through a testimony, note of thanks, or act of service—focusing solely on Him as in Exodus 15:11, and invite others to join in glad thanksgiving.
