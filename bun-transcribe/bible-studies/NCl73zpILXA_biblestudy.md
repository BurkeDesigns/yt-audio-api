# Quiet or Courageous? Facing Hypocrisy Head-On

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Galatians 2:11-16**. Read it slowly several times before answering any questions.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Look up the background of Galatia and Paul's ministry there—what challenges arose after he left, and who were the "Judaizers" influencing the churches?
2. Investigate Peter's earlier encounters with Gentiles (check Acts 10 and Acts 15:7-11)—how had God already shaped his understanding, and what does this reveal about the setting in Antioch?
3. Consider the people involved: Who was Barnabas to Paul, and why might his actions carry weight in this story?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. What was Peter's behavior before "certain men came from James" (verses 11-12), and how did it suddenly change? What motive does the text give for this shift?
2. Who else joined Peter in this change (verse 13), and what effect did it have on those watching?
3. In verse 14, what pointed question does Paul ask Peter publicly? What contradiction in Peter's life does Paul highlight?
4. Examine verses 15-16: What do Paul and Peter both know about being "justified"? How does this truth clash with the actions just described?
5. Throughout the passage, what contrasts stand out between fear-driven choices and bold, consistent faith?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence after each question. Journal your honest responses.
1. When have you noticed your own behavior shifting based on who's around you—why do you think that happens?
2. What fears (of rejection, conflict, or judgment) most tempt you to hold back your faith—where do those fears come from in your heart?
3. In moments of inconsistency, whose approval are you really seeking, and how does that feel compared to standing firm in Christ?
4. If Paul confronted you like he did Peter, what mixed signals in your life might he point out—why haven't you addressed them yet?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, prayerfully identify **one specific situation** where fear of others leads you to act inconsistently with your faith. Take a courageous step to live it out openly—share it with someone who needs to hear, or refuse to blend in—and note what God does through your obedience.
