# From Curse to Conquest: The Gardens That Changed Everything

## The Anchor Text
Have your Bible open to **Genesis chapters 2-3** and **John chapters 19-20** as you work through this guide.

## Contextual Investigation
1. Research the Garden of Eden in ancient Near Eastern context and Genesis 2: What unique role did it play in God's creation and human responsibility?
2. Investigate first-century Jewish burial customs and the location of the tomb in John 19:41-42 near Golgotha—why might this setting carry deep significance for Jesus' death?
3. Look up Mary Magdalene's background in the Gospels—what draws her to the tomb in John 20:1, and who else appears there?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
**Observation: What do you notice?**
- In Genesis 2:9 and 2:16-17, what specific elements does God place in the garden, and what command does He give Adam and Eve?
- Scan Genesis 3—what tactics does the serpent use to tempt Eve, and what immediate consequences follow for humanity (including thorns, toil, and death)?
- In John 19:1 and 19:38-42, observe the details of Jesus' suffering, burial, and the tomb's description—how does Joseph of Arimathea fit into this scene?
- Read John 20:1—what shocks Mary Magdalene at the tomb, and what do the angels say or do?

**Interpretation: What does it mean?**
- Compare the "tree" in Genesis 2-3 with the cross and thorns in John 19:1—how do these symbols connect sin's curse to Jesus' actions?
- Based on Romans 5:12 and Psalm 51:5, how does the event in Genesis 3 explain the sin nature you see affecting all people today?
- Contrast the angels' roles in Genesis 3 and John 20—what shift do you detect in their message and invitation?
- Drawing from 1 John 1:8, Isaiah 63:5, John 14:6, and Matthew 10:32, what steps emerge for responding to sin and entering relationship with Jesus?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Pause in silence with God and journal your honest responses:
1. Why do the effects of the Genesis 3 curse—like struggle, shame, or separation—still show up in your closest relationships or daily battles?
2. When you picture the empty tomb in John 20, what fears or doubts about death, forgiveness, or God's power arise in your own heart?
3. Why might publicly acknowledging Jesus (as in Matthew 10:32) feel risky or inviting to you right now?
4. In what hidden ways are you still living under Eden's curse instead of the tomb's victory—and what longing does that stir?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, identify one specific "thorn" of sin's curse in your life (from Genesis 3's consequences), confess it openly to a trusted believer as a step of commitment to Jesus (echoing the altar call in John 20), and watch for His conquering power at work.
