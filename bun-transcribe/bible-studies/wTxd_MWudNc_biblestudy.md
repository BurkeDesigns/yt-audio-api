# Fathers Without Flaw? Unearthing God's Call to Godly Leadership

## The Anchor Text
Open your Bible to **Ephesians 6:4** (read it in at least two translations). Keep **Deuteronomy 6:6-7** and **Hebrews 12:5-11** nearby for frequent reference.

## Contextual Investigation
1. What was the Roman cultural norm of *patria potestas* (father's absolute authority) in the first century? Read Ephesians 5:21-6:9—how does Paul's instruction to fathers stand in stark contrast?
2. Scan Genesis 1-50 for stories of early fathers like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their family struggles. What patterns emerge about human fatherhood in a fallen world?
3. In Deuteronomy 6:1-9, what crisis or transition is Israel facing as Moses speaks? Why might constant, everyday teaching be essential here?

## Discovery Questions (Observation & Interpretation)
1. In Ephesians 6:4, list the two specific commands given to fathers. What words or phrases describe *how* children should be raised—observe every detail.
2. Read Deuteronomy 6:6-7 closely. When, where, and how often does God's Word get impressed on children? What does this reveal about a father's role beyond just providing?
3. Examine Proverbs 13:24 alongside Proverbs 3:11-12 and Hebrews 12:5-11. What connections do you see between sparing discipline, hatred, love, and fatherly training? How is discipline pictured differently from mere punishment?
4. Compare James 1:2-4 and Romans 5:3-4 with Hebrews 12:10-11. What outcomes does Scripture promise from trials and discipline? Trace how these build character step by step.
5. Look at Proverbs 5:23. What happens without discipline? Now revisit Ephesians 6:4—what risks does "provoking to anger" pose to a child's path?
6. Thinking of flawed fathers in Scripture (like Eli in 1 Samuel 2-3 or David in 2 Samuel), what common failures do you observe? How does no human father measure up perfectly?

## Deep Reflection (Heart-Work)
Take time in silence to journal or pray through these:
1. Where in your own life—or family history—have you seen the effects of unchecked anger or absent discipline? Why do you think it lingers?
2. Recall a time when loving correction shaped you. What resistance rose in your heart then, and why might you still resist it now?
3. How does your current approach to authority (giving or receiving it) reflect trust in God's fatherly ways? What fears hold you back?
4. If God is your perfect Father, why do human examples (good or flawed) still influence how you lead or follow?

## The Discovery Challenge (Application)
This week, select one relationship where you hold influence (as parent, mentor, or leader). Intentionally weave in one moment of clear instruction from God's Word *and* firm, loving discipline daily—observe what shifts in hearts, without fixing outcomes yourself. Journal what God reveals through the process.
