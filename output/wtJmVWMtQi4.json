  "transcript": "I love the wrong thing and pursue it, it will lead to my destruction. I am capable of destroying my life with one bad decision. And so God gives us guidelines and boundaries called his word. And when you are able to know and approve the things that are good, the things that are godly, then you may be sincere, pure, without offense, blameless until Christ returns. For today, we are in Philippians chapter 1. Now I filled the pulpit for my dad, uh, maybe it was a month ago or so, and I was in Philippians chapter 2. And so my dad teaches front to back. I go back to front. Um, because we're in Philippians 1 today. So we're going backwards. But I I taught Philippians chapter 2 last month, and then I read Philippians 1. I was like, why did I, why did I skip this? This is just so spiritually rich. And so we're gonna read Philippians chapter 1 today. I'm gonna ask that you stand for the reading of God's word. You thought you got away without standing. Oh no, greeting, yes. I gotcha. Found a way. Philippians 1. Let's read the first 11 verses together. Now, this is Paul writing to the church at Philippi. He says in verse 1, Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi with the bishops and deacons. Grace to you and peace from God our Father in the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine, making request for you all with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now. Verse 6, being confident of this very thing that he who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. Can someone say Amen? Verse 7, just as it is right for me to think this of you all. Now, listen to Paul's like heart and affection for this church here. Again, verse 7 just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, and as much as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace. For God is my witness how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ. And this I pray, this is Paul's prayer for this church. This I pray that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. The title of our Bible study today is Finding Perspective in the Pain. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come to you now. We ask that you would fill this place with your presence, that you would show yourself to us, Lord, that you would, for some who are here today who don't know you, who aren't walking with you, Lord, that you would just be so real to them today, that you'd pour out your love upon them. For those of us, Lord, who've been walking with you, that you would encourage us, convict us, challenge us, stretch our faith, Lord, draw us closer to yourself. Lord, we love you. All of this is for you. We're here for you. So would you teach us, God, and would you bring back the church tour home to us safely, bring my dad back to us safely, my parents, and bless their time, Lord. We do ask that you would bless their time. It would be a time of refreshment and understanding more of your word, and so bring them home to us safely. But in the meantime, as we study together, we we just ask that you would you would teach us now that you would fillet our hearts wide open and that you would go to work by your spirit through your word. It's in Jesus' name we pray, and all God's people said, Amen. You may be seated. Before we unpack Philippians chapter one, if we don't understand the context in which Paul is writing, this is not going to make any sense. And so the context in which Paul is penning these words is not a very good one. All right, Paul is writing this letter while he is under house arrest in the city of Rome. And so the church group that's that's there in Greece, um, they they also, I think it was a few days ago, or maybe they haven't gone yet, I don't know. I mean, I I haven't really looked at their tour brochure, I've been too envious to lay my eyes upon it. But uh, they they will be, if not having, if they haven't already, they'll be going through the city of Rome where Paul pens this letter. But he's writing again, under house arrest, and that's why four times in just this chapter, he mentions that word chains. Why? Because he's literally under chains. Uh sometimes we use that that word um metaphorically and spiritually. Um, but no, Paul is literally in chains, uh, writing this letter to this city, uh to this church in the real city of Philippi, which is um in modern day Greece, more of the northern region of Greece. And so Paul's circumstances are one of pain. Um not only does he mention the word chains four times, but he also mentions the word affliction, suffering, and conflict. And not only was Paul going through affliction and suffering and conflict, but he says that the latter half of chapter one that you are sharing in this same conflict. Why? Because the early church was riddled with persecution. All right, being a Christian in Paul's day was not very popular. You think it's not very popular today, it was it was ten times worse in the pagan area of Greece, Philippi, Rome. Why? Because you you became a Christian, you potentially lost your business, lost your job, lost your source of income, lost your family. Oh, especially if you were a Jewish believer, claiming Jesus was the Messiah, your family disowned you. So the early church experienced intense persecution. But what Paul is going to do here in the book of Philippians is he's going to reshape their perspective in the midst of this pain, in the midst of this suffering in the midst of trial. And that's why all throughout this book, this book of Philippians is known as the book of joy. Why? He mentions the word rejoice or joy, roughly 18 times in this short book. And so, yes, the context is one as is of is one of pain, and yet it's the most joyful book in the Bible. And so what Paul does to his readers to this little church in Philippi is he's going to recalibrate their perspective in the midst of their pain. And I pray that this Bible study today would encourage those of you who are experiencing pain. And maybe pain for you is physical pain, and you're experiencing physical health challenges. Maybe pain for you is trials and tribulations pertaining to your work, pertaining to your job, pertaining to your family, pertaining to family tension that remains. Um I don't know what it is, and I don't have to, but the Lord does. He is keenly aware of what is going on in your life. And you need to know this, that the Lord is very well aware of what is going on in your life. And sometimes we think that God is so big and he's much more concerned with other people and other things, much bigger than what I'm going through. Psalm 37, 23, I've I've quoted this verse before because it's ministered to my heart. In the New Living Translation, Psalm 37, 23 says that God cares about the details of your life. And you need to know this today, that God cares about every single detail of your life. He sees, and he not only knows and sees, but he cares. And he desires right now by his Holy Spirit, through the teaching of his word, to minister to your situation. But you have to allow him to do that. And you have to say, God, here I am in all of my mess and all of my pain. I invite you in, Lord, go to work as uncomfortable as it might be by your spirit and do whatever you want to do and accomplish by the power of your spirit. God desires to do that today. Why? Because he loves you. And he wants you to know and experience his love. Not just in an intellectual way, but in an experiential way. And that separates Jesus from every other world religion. You can experience the love of God, not just in an intellectual philosophical way, but you can experience it. It's real, because God is not some far-off, distant ethereal force. He is a real personal being who desires to get into the mess of your life. Why? To heal and to repair and to restore. It's the heart of the Lord. Now, all of this is just an intro to what I pray is an encouragement to you today. And so Paul is writing in that context, one of pain. But what he is going to do again is recalibrate their perspective in the midst of it and how he begins this section of his letter or this ancient day email is he begins by saying in verse 6, look at verse 6 again with me, he says, being confident. Everybody say confident. Confident in the Latin, it's confide, it just means by faith. Being confident, or having intense faith of this very thing that he who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. The way that Paul starts off by encouraging these suffering believers is by saying, listen, God's begun a good work in you, and he's going to complete it. God completes the projects that he begins. Typically, we start things well, but we don't always know how to finish well. Let me illustrate it to you with this image. Started off well. Didn't finish so well. Now, this isn't my personal drawing, okay? Oh, if I could draw that the first part of that picture, I mean I'd I'd I wouldn't be doing this right now, probably. But this is this image often represents the life of the believer. You remember when you first came to know the Lord, you first fell in love with the Lord. You came into relationship with Jesus Christ, invited him into your life. Turn from sin and trusted in Jesus. That fire that you initially had, that love you had for his word, that love you had for sharing your faith with other people. And then oftentimes what happens in the course of life is we become distracted by the cares of the world, by the enemy, by the desires of the flesh, and what started off like this drawing then begins to wane over time, and we grow cold in our relationship with the Lord. And it's important for us to remember that it's not us doing the work, but it's God by his Spirit accomplishing his work and purposes in us and through us. And what happens is sometimes we exhaust ourselves trying to impress God with the good works that never saved us to begin with. Why do we do this? Why do we come to the Lord with all of our good works, thinking we're gonna impress him with our performance when it wasn't even the good works that impressed him to begin with for him to send his son to die for us? It wasn't because we were good or righteous that God says, Yeah, I want that person. Oh, I want him. I want anything good or cool about me. That God said, Yeah, I gotta have him a part of my team. No, there's there's nothing in us that was good or righteous or deserving to be a part of God's family. But no, it's because he was rich in mercy, the Bible says that he sent his son because of his love for you, that he died on the cross for your sin, and for as many as would call on the name of Jesus and repent, then welcome to the family of God. But salvation is not a good work of the believer, but it's a good work accomplished by Jesus on the cross. And then, yes, good works is in response to what Jesus did for us. But good works is not a way to merit or to attain or purchase salvation. We can't. Bible says our good works are like filthy rags compared to a holy God. So our good works, they at the end of the day, on the good bad scale, they it doesn't lift the scale high enough. Bible says, all have fallen short of God's glory. But in our performance-oriented culture, we think how I perform for God attains my right relationship with him. How I perform for God determines my peace with God. The Bible says, no, you have peace with God by believing in the work that Jesus did for you. And so we exhaust ourselves again by trying to perform for the Lord, and the Bible says, No, if you would repent of sin, have faith in the work that Jesus did for you, God says, I will pour out my Holy Spirit upon you to empower you to perform obedience. And then living for the Lord is this life of joy and rest and peace, not striving in the flesh, but resting in the strength that the Spirit provides you. But oftentimes this is our Christian experience, and we grow cold with the Lord, striving in the flesh. But today allow the Holy Spirit to accomplish his purposes in your life. And what we need to do in the midst of pain and in the midst of difficulty is remember and understand that is God working in us and through us, and God will finish what he began in your life. If you're discouraged today, because you started fresh and hot with the Lord, but now you have backslidden through sin. Don't be discouraged. God simply calls you to return to him to confess sin, and he will finish the work that he started in your life. And so, point number one in finding perspective in the pain is know that God always finishes what he starts. You are a great work in progress. Allow God to continue to grow you and mature you by his spirit. And there is great confidence in this, there is great assurance in this, that God will complete what he began in your life, and know that God always starts what he finishes. This is important, an important perspective in the midst of pain. Number two, finding perspective in the midst of pain, Paul says it's important that you maintain a close walk of purity before the Lord. Maintain a close walk of purity before the Lord. This is what verses nine through ten say. Paul says, and this I pray that your love may still abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ. Paul says, Listen, in the context of this suffering, this trial, this pain, he says, This is my prayer for you, church at Philippi. This is my prayer for you, Cornerstone Chapel. I pray that your love would still abound more and more. Now, listen, what can tend to happen in the midst of pain, trials, tribulation, is bitterness starts to arise in the heart of the believer. In the midst of pain, we be we we can tend to, because we're sinful, rebellious human creatures, we can tend to grow bitter towards the Lord. Oh God, you haven't done anything for me lately. God, I've been in the midst of this difficult challenge much longer than I expected. I'm waiting for you to deliver. And the Lord doesn't always deliver according to our timetable, but according to his. But what can tend to happen is in the midst of that difficult pain or trial or challenge, is we grow bitter towards the Lord, and then what happens? We compromise. This was the story of the nation of Israel. God tested them in the wilderness, and he tested them through trial and tribulation to test their hearts before the Lord. But what happened is they grew bitter, and they often then compromised and turned to idolatry. They rebelled against the Lord. It's no different with us. In the midst of pain, in the midst of trial and tribulation, we can often grow bitter and compromise in our walks with the Lord. And Paul says that I pray, here's the goal, that your love may abound more and more, he says, in knowledge and discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, know what pleases God, so that here's the goal, you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ Jesus. This is the goal until Jesus returns. He says that you would, as the ESV puts it, be pure and blameless, sincere and without offense, pure and blameless. This is the goal for the believer, that we would walk in purity before the Lord until Jesus returns. You need to know this. The Bible says that Jesus is coming again, and he is coming for a pure bride, the Bible says. And so he calls his believers, uh, his children to walk in purity until he returns. This is the goal. But notice this, there is a process to this purity. All right, I need you to stay with me on this one, because I'm gonna spend a little bit more time on this point number two. But if you can track with me on this, this is gonna be life-giving to you today. So the goal for the Christian is purity, walking in purity and blameless before the Lord, or sincere without offense. But Paul says there's a process to this. Notice, he says, I pray that you would abound in love. He says that your love may abound still more and more. The Christian should be characterized by one word, that word love. The Christian life should be characterized by love. Jesus would say in John chapter 13. He says, A new commandment I give you, love one another as I have loved you. So you also must love one another, and by this, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another. We are known by our love, Jesus says. You see here, Paul is qualifying what true love actually looks like. Paul is saying that true biblical love that you are to abound in is supposed to flow within the parameters of knowledge and discernment. As a river has banks, so true biblical love has banks and parameters. One bank is called knowledge, one bank is called discernment. Are you guys with me? You guys okay? All right, I love you. He says there are two banks to true love, knowledge and discernment. And it's important that true biblical love operate within these parameters. Why? Well, because you know our society's motto is what? Love is love. That's right. Love is love, meaning what? Meaning what? Love has no parameters. Love whatever feels good, love whatever seems right to you, love whatever, uh love whatever you'd like. Love is love. And Paul says, no, true love actually has parameters, banks, boundaries, and one bank is knowledge, and one way, one bank is discernment, just as a river has banks. Listen, if if water free flows out of the banks, that's called a flood, and there is much destruction. Now, water is very lifelong. Giving. Water when it remains within the parameters is very refreshing, life-giving. It can bring life to society. But water outside of those parameters, outside of those banks, is very destructive. And you we see floods in the southeastern region of our nation. We've sent teams to North Carolina and Florida. And you see the devastation and the damage and destruction that water can have when it overflows. And Paul says, the overflowing, the abounding love that I'd like you to have as believers has these parameters of knowledge and discernment. Let me give you a silly example to further illustrate my point here. I have an overflowing love for vanilla cream donuts from Duncan. Now my dad's idol is crispy cream. My idol is Duncan. America runs on it. And the vanilla cream donuts. Oh, oh, I could indulge. I can splurge. Oh, vanilla cream donuts from Duncan are just amazing. Now I know that if my overflowing love for vanilla cream donuts doesn't have boundaries, I'm in trouble. And at risk of physical health challenges, risk of diabetes and more. That's a dumb example. Let me let me give maybe a more serious example. God created sex, and sex is a wonderful thing. But God has created parameters and boundaries for sex. And the parameter he set for sex is marriage between one man and one woman. And if sex is experienced outside of those boundaries that God has prescribed, and sex can be a very destructive thing. Mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, all of the above. Now I don't give this example to say that if you have crossed God's boundaries in this way, that there is no hope or redemption or forgiveness. Repent of it, turn from it, confess it before the Lord, and God is eager to forgive, and he is eager to restore and heal. And God is eager to lavish his grace upon you. So turn from it, repent. Don't live or walk in it anymore. You know God's prescribed boundaries now, and then walk with God in his prescribed boundaries. God is not a kill joy, but God knows what is beneficial for us and what is destructive or harmful to us. And so he gives us boundaries so that we can enjoy his creation to the fullest, and we can flourish within his prescribed parameters. But when we cross his parameters, we suffer the consequences. And so our society's motto is love is love. And Paul says, no, our abounding love is to flow within knowledge and discernment, or in other words, the truth of God's word. Love one another with the truth of God's word. Why? Okay, let me let me put it to you this way. Paul is saying, love is awesome, but it is possible for us to love the wrong things. Do you not know this? That is possible for me to love the wrong thing. And if I love the wrong thing and pursue it, it will lead to my destruction. I am capable of destroying my life with one bad decision because I chased after the wrong thing that I loved. And so God gives us guidelines and boundaries called His Word. And if we follow the parameters of His Word, life is awesome. We flourish in this thing that in this thing called love. We are to love other people within these boundaries of knowledge and discernment, truth. And when we flow within these boundaries, we are able to love people with the true love of Christ. It is not real love when you affirm people in their sin. It's not true love. But to love people with knowledge and discernment, getting into the scriptures. And Paul is saying, I want you to be directed by truth, so that he continues, we're making our way to the goal of purity, when you, when your love flows within the boundaries of knowledge and discernment, he says, you're able then to approve the things that are excellent. Or the NLT says you're able to understand what really matters. You're able to know what pleases God. You know the heart of God. And so you know now what really matters. You're able to approve, or the the word literally means examine. You're able to examine the things that are excellent, the good things. And when you are able to know and approve the things that are good, the things that are godly, then you may be sincere, pure, without offense, blameless until Christ returns. This is God's heart for us as believers. Now, get this, I'm not done. I'm not done with this point. This is so this is so awesome right here. He says, so that you may be sincere. Now that word sincere, it's two Greek words. Okay, again, the goal is to be sincere, pure believer. Lord, help me by your Holy Spirit to do that. I can't do that on my own. Sincere is two Greek words combined, hele crine. Hele meaning the rays of the sun and krine or krino meaning to judge. Literally to be judged by sunlight. I pray that you would be sincere or judged by sunlight. What in the world does that mean, Paul? Now check this out. This is so cool. In ancient times, um, pottery was all the rage. I think pottery is still cool now. Um we have pottery barn. That's pretty cool. Do they even sell pottery there? I don't know. Um, I've never been in there. But pottery in ancient times, um, it was all over the place. So you go to Israel with our with our church team, you just see pottery just lying all over the place. The the team there in Greece right now, they're probably just bathing in pottery. That's how it's how it works over there. And so, in um, that was a rough mental image I just had in my mind. In the marketplace, a a pottery dealer, someone selling pottery, someone who is out to get you or to steal your dollar, or I guess your shekel, let's say. Obviously, pottery is very fragile, and so pottery is susceptible to breaking. But what a what a dealer would do if they were just trying to rob you of your change is they would seal all of the cracks with wax. It'd seal all of the cracks with wax, and so when you would go to the marketplace to purchase pottery, let's just say you had a jar, the only way that you were able to tell if you were purchasing a genuine product is if you did the sun test, if you held that piece of pottery up to the sun, and the sun would expose this the sealed cracks filled with wax, it would shine right through. And so, what honest pottery dealers would do is they would stamp on their jar sencera, sincere, meaning without wax. And Paul says, Is your life without wax? Or are you just covering up? Paul says the life of the Christian should be one of sincera, one without wax, genuine, no duplicity, nothing fake or phony. And yet we do this, we come to church dressed in our best. Think, Austin, is that the best you had? Well, just for today, please be gracious. I I am not been getting much sleep. I have a new child. I move on. So we come to church, dressed in our best, and that we we leave this building, and we live lives of duplicity, one way in the church and one way outside of the church. Why do we do this? We should be living lives of genuineness, of sincerity. There's nothing fake or phony, and this is impossible. I'll just be real with you. This is impossible because we are never the same person everywhere we go. We do things, but the Lord knows it all. The Lord knows it. And we can't live lives of sincerity or genuineness on our own. It has to be God living and moving in us by his Holy Spirit. And God reveals the cracks of our life. But what we do is rather than covering up or sealing our lives with wax, which melts when it hits the sun, we say, God, would you fix the brokenness of my life? I don't want to live a life of phoniness. I don't want to be duplicitous in my walk with you. I don't want to be coming to church giving that smile and then living in sin the next day. God, I want to be a genuine, sincere, pure believer walking before you. But it needs you fill, it needs you working in my life by your Holy Spirit. So reveal to me the places that I have tried to cover up, and then confess, confess your sin to the Lord. And again, as far as the East is from the West, so far will he remove your transgressions from you. If we confess our sin, 1 John 1, 8 and 9, says, if we confess our sin, he's faithful and just to forgive us, not seal us up with wax that'll melt the next day, but to forgive us, wash us, make us whole. That's what God is able to do. We're not able to pick up the broken pieces of our fragile hearts. But what did Jeremiah say? He says, God, I am the clay, but you are the potter. And God is the great potter of our hearts is able to fashion us into new creatures. And that's why Paul would say, therefore, if there is anyone in Christ, he's a new creation. The old is gone, the new is come. And so, again, in the midst of pain, what can happen is compromise. We don't see God's deliverance as quickly as we'd like. And Paul reassures the church at Philippi, it's incumbent upon us as believers in the midst of pain to Maintain a close walk of purity before the Lord. And he will do it. The Holy Spirit will help you. Number three, point three of five, finding perspective in the pain, trust that God can use our bad circumstances to accomplish his good purposes. Paul then continues in his letter to say in verse 12. But I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel. Verse 13, so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard and to all the rest that my chains are in Christ. And most of the brothers in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. You see, Paul says, I'm literally chained. My circumstances on the outside are poor, but God has other plans in mind. And what God will do in your life in the midst of your pain is you need to trust that he's going to take your pain. Paul says, look at me, look at my chains. He says, My chains actually was for the furtherance of the gospel. I'm chained to these guards under house arrest. And they have no other choice but to hear the gospel as I pen this letter. It can't escape it. So I'm not really chained to them, Paul says, I'm chained to Christ. I belong to the Lord. And so God is using my poor physical circumstances to actually further the gospel. And then he says there in verses 13 and 14 that other people, other believers are now looking at my chains, and they're getting bold to share their faith in the Lord. And so my chains, my bad circumstances, God is accomplishing through it his good purposes. And God will do the same in your life. In the midst of your pain, God will accomplish his good purposes. And you have to know this. You have to hold on to this. You have to cling to this truth. This time last year, I had just finished up rehab on my left Achilles. I tore my, I tore my Achilles tendon. Many of you saw me about a year ago walking and hobbling around in a boot, and I'd torn my ruptured my left Achilles just playing some pickup football. And to some of you that sounds like a uh a really rough injury, and to others of you, you're going through far worse, and so a torn Achilles is nothing. Umetheless, when you go through physical challenges or injuries, it is very discouraging. I'll be real with you. Um I tore my Achilles and had surgery to repair it, and then a few weeks and months of tedious, tiresome rehab, um, there were seasons of discouragement saying, Lord, would you teach me? Lord, would you, would you show me what what your what your plan is in the midst of this? Because it's uncomfortable and it's painful and um I feel helpless and I can't serve my my wife and my family, and you you can't enjoy the same things that you used to enjoy. And so there's seasons of deep discouragement, and many of you right now know exactly what I'm talking about. And so it was the very um, it was around Easter time, again, this time last year, and it was the very last session of my rehab. And I had an awesome physical therapist, and um, he had been walking me through the process, and he knew I was a pastor, and I worked here at the church. And he asked me again, right before Easter. He said, What are you doing this weekend? And I said, Well, my my Easter weekend is typically busy. I'll be at the church for all of our services. And uh, hey, why don't you come? And I told him the Easter times and invited him, and he was he was uh about my age, young guy, and um, and uh really sweet, awesome, nice guy. And he said, you know what? I think I will, and he lived with some roommates. He said, I'm gonna invite my my guy friends, my roommates, uh, to Easter at Cornerstone. And I don't know the end of that story. I don't know if if him and his roommates came or not. If they did, um maybe the Lord used my dad's message over Easter weekend, and maybe they came to Christ. I don't know. Maybe in the least, a seed was planted, and years later, I may never know how the Lord used my Achilles' injury to bring him to Easter weekend to bring him to Christ. And many of you have stories just like that. And there is purpose in the pain. Corey Tenboom, I quote her often. She was very familiar with pain. She said that there is no panic in heaven. God has no problems, only plans. Your situation is no problem to God. He is working his marvelous plan through it. Trust him. Keep going. Don't be discouraged. Press on and trust that God can use your bad circumstance to accomplish his good plan and purposes in your life. He will do it. He sees the full picture. We only see a piece of the puzzle. Don't be frustrated with the Lord, but allow the Lord to minister to your situation. He sees it all. He knows beginning to end, and he will use your life to accomplish amazing purposes. Number four, I'm gonna roll through the next two points. Keep an eternal perspective. He would then later say in verse 21, for to me to live as Christ and to die is gain. That's a coffee mug verse for you right there. Easy to have on our coffee mugs as we're sipping in the morning, harder to sometimes grasp and understand. Paul always was bringing his readers from their problems onto his presence, saying, guys, in the midst of your suffering and pain, you have to keep this eternal perspective. That there is heaven waiting for the believer, that this is as bad as it gets for the believer. If you don't know the Lord, this is as good as it gets, come to the Lord. Turn from sin, trust in Christ. You have heaven waiting for you. And this is as bad as it gets, and keep that eternal perspective. Paul says, for to me now to live, it's all about Christ, but to die is far better, he says. And he's honest with this church. He says, Listen, if I were totally transparent with you, I'd rather depart and be with Christ, he says. That's the better option, Paul says. He says, but I know that God still has a plan for me because it's more beneficial for you that I stay and remain and encourage you in the faith. So there's no death wish in this. Paul is just simply being honest. I'm gonna remain, and while I remain, it's all about Christ, but I'm being real, I'd rather depart and be with him. That's far better. Keep that eternal perspective to die as gain. Listen, death for the believer. It's just the beginning. It's just the beginning. It's wonderful promise that the Lord has for us. And this needs to be our attitude as believers. God is good. And so, in the let's, in the midst of it, all the time. That's right. In the midst of it, say, God, you're coming for me. And that leads to Paul's final point. Stand fast in suffering. Your salvation is near. Finding perspective in the pain, stand fast, he says in verse 27. Stand fast in one spirit with one mind, striding together for the faith of the gospel, and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perition or a sign of their destruction, but to you of salvation and that from God. So he says, stand fast. He says, your salvation is near when you stand fast in the faith and don't waver. That's actually gonna be a sign to an unbeliever of destruction. Hopefully, God will use that, your testimony as you stand fast. God will use that testimony to grab a hold of the unbeliever to bring them to Christ. So you stand fast. He says, your salvation is near. And many of you need to hear this today. Stand fast. Be immovable, stay in the word. Pray and ask to be filled afresh with God's Spirit. He will fill you afresh with his presence and help you to stand fast in the midst of the pain. Heavenly Father, we thank you for our time together. I pray, Lord, that you would use these verses to continue to encourage those who are here going through a difficult season. Lord, I pray that you would pour out your mercy, your love, and your blessing upon your people today, God. Help us to walk in purity, Lord, to love and approve the excellent things. God, we can only do this by your Holy Spirit, Lord. And so as I've done my best to present the word, Lord, only you and your power can accomplish whatever you desire in our hearts. And so would you do that, Lord, by your spirit, accomplish your good purposes in us as we leave this building, pour out your love and lavish us in your love, we pray. It's in Jesus' name and all God's people said. Amen.",
