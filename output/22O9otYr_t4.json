  "transcript": "Over the past four years, an astounding 51,000 students from seven states, five countries, and a hundred and eighty-three schools have responded to the gospel message because of the whosoever's kill the noise tour. A 15-year-old living in today's world gathers as much information in one day as a 15-year-old 80 years ago would have gathered in one full year. Do you realize the youth suicide rate is at an all-time high? Listen, in the next 24 hours in the USA alone. Every 100 minutes, a teen takes their own life. 2,795 teenage girls will become pregnant. And 15,000 and six teens will use drugs for the first time. The increasing amount of noise bombarding our students daily is destroying their minds and souls at an alarming rate. For this reason, the whosoever's kill the noise tour is a necessity. All right, dude, we are at the Kill the Noise Tour. We're in California right now, and it's about to pop off. We need kingdom builders like you to join us in this battle against the ever-increasing noise that surrounds the lives of these students. Please consider helping us expand this mission by partnering with the whosoever's kill the noise tour. Thank you for empowering future generations with us. Hello, wow. Look at all these people. Amazing to see all you guys come out for the revival night. Thank you guys for having me. Gary, Austin, uh Tyler. I called Tyler the wrong name yesterday, and we've had beef ever since, so I love you, man. Hey, um, thank you guys for coming out for revival night. I'm so excited. What you guys seen with the school tour. We do a hundred schools a year globally. Um, we're praying that the doors will open in the east coast. Please contact us if you are connected to the schools. All roads lead to the Bible club on campus, whether it's the FCA, Young Life, it's maybe a Bible club from the local church. All we need is one student in the school to get to start a Bible club, and we could go in and preach the gospel, and this what you're seeing is basically that was just two days of filming in Los Angeles, but we are seeing these crowds of students just coming to Jesus. People are empty and they're looking for the truth, and guess what? We have the answer. So they're running, coming to Jesus, they're repenting, giving their life to Christ, getting plugged into the Bible Club, and then the Bible Club will plug them into the local church, and that's how we connect the dots. So keep us in prayer, and I'm excited for tonight. And I think that you guys all came like ready to receive, right? Like you're excited, you're like, God, what are you gonna do? Like what's gonna happen at this night. And that what that's basically what revival night is about. It's coming expecting God to move, God to speak to you, God to touch your life, God to do the supernatural in the natural realm where however he wants to meet you. Now remember this, the Lord will only take you as far as you will let him. So this is the night to get real with God. As we enter a time of worship, just open your heart, sing like you've never seen, just praise the Lord and ask him to just feel you and do whatever he wants to do in this night. Also, as we open the word, as you believe you receive, and God is gonna do just amazing things as I teach on the power and the work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life and the function of it and where the Holy Spirit comes from and what he wants to do in and through us as believers. So we got an amazing night of awesome stuff gonna happen. So I want to open it up with prayer. Lord, in Jesus' name, I ask that you open the gates of heaven and you will pour out your spirit upon this place. I pray that you will answer prayers. I pray that you will move by your spirit through your word as you will impact us as you will speak to us, Lord. Lord, all the things that are in our life, the noise, just from the day, all the cares, I pray in Jesus' mighty name that you will just break that stuff off of us, and that you will allow us to tune in to your spirit and hear what the spirit has to say to us tonight in this place. I pray in Jesus' mighty name that as we've come in that we will leave completely different, that the power and the operation of the Holy Ghost will be manifesting in a more powerful way. Our faith will be increased, and we will want to be used by you, Lord. So Lord, not our will, but thy will be done as it is on earth as it is in heaven, in Jesus' mighty name, amen.

All these strongholds that need to be broken, Lord. And to also just learn so much more about you and who you are, Father. We thank you, we love you. Jesus' name. Amen. You guys could be seated. High school's when it all started. One of my friends introduced me to the rave scene around that time in 1990. To go to like a rave, you'd have to call a number at 12 o'clock at night. Then they give you directions to a map point. So you drive out from you know, drive out in the middle of no, I mean somewhere in LA, just at a shop or somewhere, you show up on the corner of the street, you pay five bucks to 20 bucks, depending on the thing. Then they give you a little piece of paper like a fortune cookie with the directions to the place, which led you to Compton. You show up in Compton or Watts when that ghetto of ghettos, like straight like neighborhoods where you can get killed. You pull up your park your car, you go up to this back industrial alley to this to this place, and you just hear like money. You just start hallucinating and going nuts, and other with the loud speakers and nitrous balloon, and you're pretty much just it's just a wild ride at that point. I had a couple friends that actually went mentally insane. Um couple guys are schizo, a couple guys, one guy jumped off a cliff on LSD and killed himself, another guy jumped in front of a train. It's just like I'm lucky I'm I'm alive with a sane mind at this point. Well, I grew up in Los Angeles in Southern California. I was just, you know, skateboard like a normal kid and and surf and when I was in first grade. I remember finding like a big duffel bag of porn magazines in the back of my school. When I got to fourth grade, I saw a video and I kind of started understanding what was going on in those pictures. It just warped things in my mind. I don't know. When I got to high school, got introduced to cocaine. It was more experimental at that time in high school, but then after high school is when it started getting more of a habit where it just turned into a routine where that's just what I did. That's just what I did. I just party. When I started my new job, that's you know, when everything took off, and we were working with a lot of big name people, so a lot of opportunities open for Playboy Mansion parties. Um, you know, the vivid porn star girls would host our parties. During the summer, we'd go to Europe for a month and a half, we'd film videos, shoot for magazines, travel with musicians and go on tour with them, and then uh we do video premieres with our skate videos. I'd wake up, go to work, go skate, go get wasted. Wake up, go skate, go or go work, go skate, get wasted. But I had a nice house. I had the the motorcycles. I literally done laps around the world like three to four times, and you know, sleep with as many girls as you know, a lot of girls and the drugs, nothing gets me off anymore. You know, I couldn't, I was empty, it's just nothing made me happy. Then I did a tour through uh Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama City, and I just did cocaine the whole time. One of our team riders found me in my bed with cocaine all over my face and all over the counter, and they couldn't wake me up, they thought I OD'd. All I know is I woke up the next morning and they said, dude, we thought you were dead last night. And at that point, I just realized I gotta change my life. I went to my hotel room, and I was uh by myself for the first time and sober for the first time in at least a month and a half to two months, and I was in Panama City at the Sheraton Hotel, and I just remember going, Jesus, if you're real, I need you to prove that you're real to me. And I just I remember this prayer my dad would say, just say, Jesus, forgive me for my sins, come into my life and fill me with your holy spirit. And I said that prayer, I said, prove that you're real to me because I see religion around me. I see my parents and these Christians, and I don't relate to them. And I remember going, well, okay, well, what can I do now? I said, I need to like read the Bible, right? And I start looking through the the Panama drawers. There has to be a Bible in the hotel room. They have Bibles all over the world. I'd always see them. And I'd always be like, ugh, you know. I open it up, there's a blue Bible there. It's a Gideon Bible, pull it out, I'd start reading it. I was waiting for this supernatural experience. You know, I've taken a lot of drugs, I've seen a lot of stuff, and I thought that God was gonna show up in his heavenly glory with angels and whatnot, but that didn't happen. So I got the Bible, I stole it from the hotel, I put it in my backpack, got on the plane, and I was surrounded by all the skate team, and they were looking at me, and they must have been tripping because they're like, this guy is uh he lives his life like a pirate. And I just remember looking at him saying, you know what? If God's real, I'm gonna find him because he's in this book. This is God's word. So I just read that Bible, that Gideon Bible for six hours straight, all the way to LAX, and I remember I landed and I just had peace in my life for the first time in my life, I think. I just felt peace. The next morning I wake up, I hear this song singing through my head. I remember just getting up out of my bed and opening my eyes and I was just and I hear the song singing. This is the day the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in him. And it kept repeating over and over, it's just like this little song. I'm tripping out at this point, and I'm like, I gotta call my dad. My dad's a Christian, he could tell me what this means. I call him up, I'm like, hey, dad. I'm like, dude, I gave my life to the Lord in Panama City. You know, I go I'm coming off drugs. I go out I I have a uh a heroin addiction, smoking crack and using a lot of cocaine and drinking a lot. And I said, but I give my life to Jesus in the hotel room, but the problem is I woke up this morning and I hear the song singing through my head. This is the day the Lord has made. And he said, Ryan, that's the Holy Spirit, and God is calling you, and he has a plan for your life. And at that point, I knew that God was real. I just started following him, reading, praying, going to church. I decided I'm not gonna sleep with girls because you know, I know it's in the Bible that I shouldn't be like sleeping with girls. I'm not using drugs, I'm going to church, but I'm watching porn because I'm like, no one knows about that. It's a secret, secret deal. But as I'm going to church, God's working in my life, He's transforming my mind and my heart. And all of a sudden I come to this verse in Matthew, and it talks about Jesus said to the disciple, He said, if you want to be my followers, you gotta turn from your selfish ways, pick up your cross and follow me. My porn problem and the things I want to do, I gotta grab that and throw it on the cross and crucify it and kill it. Just the way uh Jesus hung on the cross with his flesh and and died for our sins. My flesh has to die on that cross. I gotta follow Jesus. So I stop watching porn, and I start, you know, every night I go home. You know, I'm getting these thoughts of watching porn, but by the power of the Holy Spirit that's working in my life, I'm praying to God, I'm like yelling at God, like God help me. Help me. I don't want to watch porn, Lord. I want to follow you. I don't want to to say something and do something else. I want to be like you, I'm gonna be like the disciples. And I just started following Jesus, and then an opportunity comes up that you know that I can go to Israel, and I'm like, I want to go to the holy land. I want to go see where Jesus walked. I wanna I want I'm going through the Bible, want to know. So I call Sonny Sandoval, the lead singer from POD and said, hey dog, I'm I'm a Christian now, and I'm going to Israel, and you want to roll out. A couple days later, we ended up in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus prayed to the Father, and Poncha Warz gave this story. He said, You guys, you go make peace with Jesus, and you go get rid of whatever you gotta get rid of and leave all that baggage here at the garden. I remember going out there to the garden. And I just prayed. I said, God. Said, I don't know what you're gonna do with me. I don't even know what you can do with me. Like, who am I? Like, I I don't even know how I can serve you. But I said, if you want me to follow you, and you want to use me, and you want me to share my story, then have someone contact me outside of my immediate circle to have me share my story. And if you call me out, then I'll go and I'll share my story, and I will not go back to the to the um to my old job, and I will follow you wherever that takes me. I said that prayer, and I happened to get a phone call the next day. It was this guy. Derek Niner in Calvary Chapel, um Las Vegas. And he said, Hey man, I would love for you to come out and share your story. At my church. Heard you got saved. And I was like, Yeah, I'll come. I'll come. But after I hung up the phone, I was just like, I was just joking, Jesus. That was a joke. I didn't know that. I know it was gonna happen. You want to know words that would describe my life. I would say, I'm not perfect. I don't have everything figured out, completely rough around the edges, but I know that Jesus Christ is Lord of my life, and I'm gonna follow him. Whatever he does in my life. Well, that was like 19 years ago. Can you believe that? All that God can do, you just surrender your life to God. Jesus, like I said on Sunday, never told me where we were going, because I would have folded. I was like, no way, not doing it. I can't do it. But through the power of the Holy Spirit, he did it, and he'll do it in you. Anyone that's here tonight, he will do it if you surrender. So at the end of the video, I said you become a new creation in Christ. All the old things will pass away, and all things will become brand new. And God renews your mind, which comes from Romans chapter 12, verses one to two. And that's gonna be the theme for tonight. And I'm gonna read it for you. It says this. And so, dear brothers and sisters, so he's speaking to all of us here today. So, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because all he has done. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice, the kind that he will find acceptable. Not me, but he will find acceptable. This is the true way to worship him. Don't copy the behaviors or the customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think or renewing your mind. And then at that time, then you will learn to know God's will, which is good, pleasing, and perfect. And the question tonight, or maybe you've asked this before, what is God's will for my life? What does he have? What is his will that's good, pleasing, and perfect? Well, right here, he gives it to us. First of all, we gotta give our bodies as a living sacrifice, and then we cannot conform to the things of the world, but we gotta let God transform our mind so we could get the mind of Christ, because remember, God doesn't speak to flesh, and then when we have the mind of Christ and He transforms us at that time, then you will learn to know God's will, which is good, pleasing, and perfect. But how can these verses become a reality to us tonight? Jesus said, like I taught on in Matt in uh John on on Sunday, he said, walk in the light, so the darkness will not overtake you. And that's through true repentance, reading the word of God and the power of the Holy Spirit operating in our life, and you will have a personal revival. But what does revival mean anyway? Is it all getting jacked up on Mountain Dew and running around and falling out and barking like dogs and laughing and all that insanity that you see on Instagram? I was messing with Instagram, I started watching one, I got caught in the algorithm. So I started to send it to all my pastors' friends, we're all laughing and stuff, right? But is it that? The answer is no. What revival is when you look it up in the dictionary, it says it's an awakening, it's a renewal. You will be revived. The revive means to be restored to life or to consciousness. But some of us here are walking around like the the walking dead TV show, but spiritually dead inside. You're walking you're just walking around, you hear some noises and parties and different events or whatever, and you're just going, but you're just spiritually dead inside. And I know that feeling, and that was my life pretty much until I gave my life to Jesus Christ in that hotel room, and I had a personal revival. Now, I've never been the same. Now I'm not perfect by any means. You could ask my wife and my mother-in-law, and just for the record, I love my mother-in-law, and she loves me, but I'm not perfect. Like I said, I have issues, but they're not the issues that I had back then, because God's been refining me through the fire and the power of the Holy Spirit, burning out the stuff that is not of him and changing me. I'm not perfect, but I've never been the same from that day, and neither will you. And now, by God's grace, I'm a father, I'm a husband. I met my wife Crystal Reese, and I have triplet daughters. I have a son, Asher, my father, Raw Reese, pastor of Calvary Chapel in Los Angeles, and my late mother Sharon. And then I started uh got a call to do evangelism 17 or 19 years ago, and basically ever since then I've been touring the world. Uh it was started from with the lead singer from the band POD, Sonny Sandoval, and uh the name comes from John 3.16. Whosoever believeth, and now our mission is the schools. Why? Because it's the battlefield. Darkness has invaded our culture, and it's happening through nine to eleven hours of screen time on average, if you just read the statistics, with filthy videos and images that are desensitizing and destroying the hearts of minds of adults in the church, adults and youth in the church, and outside the church. The enemy is in our house. You could have all the doors locked, guns blazing, and someone could be in your house across from your coffee table watching the gnarliest stuff. The enemy has invaded our homes. The music industry is brainwashing this generation with pornographic and satamic images. You got that song that Carly B came out with a while ago. I'm not gonna even say the name because I don't want to catch on fire in church right now, but it had a long time ago, it had one billion views, which is one eighth of the world's population. That was a long time ago, and that was just on one platform. Dojo Cat with her song Demons showing sleep paralysis and like all kinds of really demonic stuff. You watch that stuff, you're gonna have that stuff. Little Nas X slithering down the tree in the Garden of Eden looking like half man, half snake, hooking up with another guy and descending to hell and doing nasty stuff with Satan. I was showing my dad this stuff. I was like, Dad, check this out. He's like, that's disgusting. I'm all dad, check this out. I'm like, they're making this stuff for kids. He's like, I cannot believe it. This makes Ozzy Osborne look like my little pony. Then we have the indoctrination of the LGBTQ, drag queens on Disney, Netflix, our politicians continue to change school curriculum and laws to destroy the family values and morals. I'm from Cali, but I heard they're doing it out here too. We even got the Church of Satan down in San Clemente in South Orange County where I live. That's a very conservative area. Insanity is going on, and because of the constant consumption of this darkness, we are now seeing the effects of a global epidemic depression, anger, suicide, anxiety, fear, hopelessness, pornography, drug addiction, demon oppression, and demon possession, which now we call a mental health crisis. It's a worldwide emergency. The mainstream solution is they eat antidepressants like Tic Tex and self-medicate. This is why we have a generation of zombies. Hence, this is where we got mumble wrap from. All right, all right, I'm just making sure you guys are current. The whole reason why I started a revival night. Let me let me just mumble wrap is they're rapping, but they can't because they're on Xanax, but it's real, believe me. I'm like, huh? Okay, I told you. The whole reason why I started a revival night is because the Holy Spirit spoke to me through the verse about the state of the church and the culture at large. But I want to I want to paint a picture. So you know that old saying, garbage in, garbage out. So let's think about coachella porta potty sewage water at three o'clock in the morning. You got a visual? Okay. Now, garbage in, garbage out, sewage and sewer out. Jesus says, as he addressed screen time 2,000 years ago, Matthew 6, 22 to 23, Jesus said this. The eye is a lamp to the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. And if then that light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness. So some people might think they have the light of Christ in them, but it's actually darkness. How great is that darkness? That's sobering. A lot of people can go to church and go through the motions, but yet they're just putting in sewage water in, sewage water out. And what are the side effects? Depression, anger, suicide, oppression. Why is there a mental health crisis? Just garbage in, sewage water, port a potty sewage water all day long. See, there's a supernatural encounter that happens when we agree. I heard Chuck Smith talk about this. He says, if you're watching nasty stuff, if you're watching murderous films, if you're watching witchcraft and you're watching dark shows and stuff, that means you are a green witch. With it. And when you agree with it, you're opening the supernatural realm to the dark side, dark side for the enemy to come in. Ephesians 6, we wrestle not against flesh and blood enemies, but against principalities of darkness of the unseen world. Okay? So you open the doorways. How do I know that? Because I talk to kids all the time, and I got some stories about it and myself that has happened to me. Now, in the same way, you come here. You're singing the songs, you're agreeing with the lyrics, you're listening to the word of God, you're hearing it, and there's a supernatural event that happens as you start encountering the Holy Spirits. First John verse uh chapter one, verse five to seven says this. This is a message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you that God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. So we are lying if we say that we have fellowship with God, but go on and living in spiritual darkness. We are not practicing the truth. What's the opposite of truth? That means we are living a lie. But if we are living in the light as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin. So we know the problem. It's Satan and his minions, the fallen angels, and what is the solution? It's Jesus. And we we need to walk with Christ, and we need to be a Christian. And when we call ourselves Christian, it means we're Christ like. But it is an impossibility to be a Christian and be Christ-like without the power of the Holy Spirit operating in our high life. The power from heaven. All right, we're gonna keep going. Let's do it. John, so I'm gonna jump into John chapter 14, verse 15 to 17, and I wanna talk about the Holy Spirit. Because as we get into the operation, we need to kind of know where he came from, what is operation, and then we're gonna talk about stories and all that awesome cool stuff that he does in a believer's life. So we know that Jesus came on a rescue mission out of eternity. He went from town to town, village to village. What do you do? Preached the gospel, which was the good news. This is what we're doing with the revival nights and the public schools. It's the Jesus model. So they just got done with the Last Supper meal, and Peter kicks off a question session, and now Jesus responds, and he says this. He says, If you love me, obey my commandments. He gives us free will. If you love me, obey my commandments. So we have a choice. It's just like in the Garden of Eden, he put the tree there. Free choice. If you love me, obey my commandments, and I will ask the Father, and He will give you another advocate who will never leave you. The Greek word translated for advocate is parakletos. It's used when you're calling for like an attorney, or it means the call alongside, or to assist, to help, or the comforter. So Jesus is saying to the disciples, God will give you another advocate who will never leave you. And we know the scripture says he will never leave you nor forsake you. And you might be in a season right now where you're dealing with fear. Years ago, I was my book was about to come out, and I got hit with fear. I was getting crippled with fear. I felt like I was drowning at night. I've never been scared to do anything, but this I was just getting fear, and I don't know if you've ever experienced this, but I hear about people going, I had anxiety attacks or this and that. And I'm like, what is up with that? Christian, spirit-filled, fear. And how I got through it, I was reading, I was praying, and by God's grace, I was like on a roller coaster just holding on for my dear life. I didn't think I was gonna get through. You know those seasons? I got through. It took months, but I got through because Jesus says the Holy Spirit is in you, he will never leave you nor forsake you. You might be in a season of loss. I just lost my mom to breast cancer uh and liver cancer uh a year ago, and maybe you're going through that. Maybe you're in a season of frustration. Man, I need breakthrough or separation from family members or something, or like divorce, you're on the brink of divorce, you're in the middle of a divorce, you just came out of a divorce, or you're maybe in a season of doubt. You're doubting God, distracted. Oh man, we could get distracted, or lack of faith, or addiction of some sort. Maybe you've been on a spiritual vocation. Just know this. The Holy Spirit, he will never leave you and never forsake you. Jesus continues in verse 17. He says, He is the Holy Spirit who leads into all truth. So Jesus said the Holy Spirit is a he, not a she, not a they, them, their thou, whatever. Just so you guys know I'm not woke. So who is the Holy Spirit anyway? And how can we, how can he lead us into all truth? First off, he's a part of the Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. They're the three in one. The best illustrations is an egg. You got the egg, the egg shell, the egg white, and the egg yolk. The three are one. You know, I I ordered a bunch of wood to my house when I moved uh to I went to Idaho because God called me there to work on a building project. But I ordered a bunch of wood, wood, nails, and I ordered some coping. And those three elements, when I put them together, it became a half pipe in my garage. Anyway, the three became one. My wife hated it, so I had to remove it from my garage. So the three become one. Chuck Smith breaks it down like this. The scripture tells us this in Genesis chapter one, twenty-six. It says, Then God Elohim, which is the original Hebrew word, said, Let us, plural pronoun make man in our image according to our likeness. Just who's God talking to anyway. Let us, after our image and our likeness. We see they are one, but they have distinct personalities and roles. Look at Genesis 1, verses 1 to 2, at the very beginning of the Bible. It says, In the beginning, God, which is Elohim, created the heavens and the earth. When was the beginning? I have no idea. But whenever it was, God was, and he created the heavens and the earth, was formless and empty, and the darkness covered the deep waters, and the spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Here you have the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost all operating together right through the beginning of the Bible. Then we look at Luke, the story of Mary, the virgin getting married to Joseph, and Gabriel shows up, and he's like, Surprise, I sit in God's presence. How you doing? And she's like, What? And then he's like, I got another surprise. You're gonna get pregnant. And then she's like, she replies, Mary asks, says to the angel, but how can this happen? I'm a virgin. The angel replied, the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the most high will overshadow you so that the baby will be born, will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God, the Trinity operating together right there in the New Testament. And then in Matthew, when Jesus comes to the wilderness to a sketchy-looking cousin, John the Baptist in the desert, right? Remember him? Camel hair, long hair, eating locusts and honey for fashion. I guess he had a belt or something, but nevertheless, he's out there, and Jesus says, Will you baptize me? And he ends up dunking them. And after the baptism, Jesus came up out of the water, and the heavens were open, and he saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove and settling on him. And a voice from heaven said, This is my dearly loved Son who brings me great joy, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together. Look close at this. Jesus was baptized with water by John, and the Father God baptized with the Holy Spirit, the power from heaven. John the Baptist says, I baptize with water unto repentance, but Jesus will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire, water baptism and the Holy Ghost baptism. And later when Jesus commissioned the disciples to go out and teach in Matthew uh 28, he says, all the new converts baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Then Jesus told the disciples before going to heaven, do not leave on mission until you are baptized with the Holy Spirit. And then they're there on the day of Pentecost, and they're in the room and they're praying and they're waiting and hanging out, and the Holy Spirit fell upon the room as Jesus said would happen. And before that, Jesus says, But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you in Acts 1.8. And he says, and you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere in Judea, throughout Judea, Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. That word power is where dunamis, the original word comes from, and our translation is dynamite. Dynamite, explosive power will come upon you, and when you're submerged in it, you will be baptized and you will have the power from heaven in you. And we know the Holy Spirit's in us, he's with us, and his power will come upon us, and he will flow through our lives. And you might be asking the question what kind of power is Jesus talking about exactly. Luke 9 1, it says this one day Jesus called together his 12 disciples, and he gave them the power and authority to cast out all demons and heal all diseases. Okay, that kind of power is what we're talking about. And if you want the name of Jesus to have authority in your prayer life, like when you speak out and pray or behind closed doors, wherever it's at, you and you want to see the power happen out in public, there must be a full surrender to the Lordship of Jesus. Out in public behind closed doors when no one's looking around. Let me give you an example. So when you when someone comes to you and they're like, Will you pray for me for my marriage? It's it's this and that, or can you pray? We've been having problems getting pregnant, and there's been people because we had infertility in our in our deal. Um, and now people hear that story, and we prayed for people and they couldn't get pregnant for years, and we lay hands on it, we pray, and boom, a baby comes, right? And that's happened a couple times because it's God that does it, it's not us. We are just the vessel that steps out by faith, or like a healing. Last we did revival night down in um in Maryland, uh Helicott City, and there was a girl that came up. I just got a text from the the senior pastor over there, and he says, There was a girl around that you prayed for last night that had her eyes were blurring, she had to get surgery, and she came up to me. We anointed her with oil, we prayed for her, and he says that she got healed that night, and basically she's healed. So this stuff happens, or you get a word of knowledge. You know, when you when you're asking for a word of knowledge, you gotta be in tune to the spirit, but it comes through relationship. You know, I God just he'll like flow words, or like you'll hear words, or you know, if you have visions or or pictures, he'll he'll give you stuff to see, and then that could be the word that he wants to do, or even casting out a demon. We are at my dad, uh we were gonna go to this high school in rancho cucamungo a couple years ago, and there was 13 suicides uh the first week of school in the middle school and the high school. So that when they called the whosoever's they go over, we were about to go in, and the librarian was an atheist, and she did everything in her power to stop us from coming in that day. So we got blocked. We went back to my dad's church. My dad's like, hey, Ryan, he's all there's a girl downstairs, you need to go talk to her. She's with her mom and her little sister, and she does not look good, a younger girl. So I walk downstairs, and there's some pastors uh with them from our church, and they're like, hey, I'm like, what's going on? They go, she's being oppressed. And I go, okay, so what's up? They go, We're gonna we're gonna pray for her and we're gonna let her go home. I go, okay. So I sit down and I look, I'm sitting down on the couch right in front of her, she's right there, and I look at her, and the Holy Spirit gives me a word of knowledge and goes, she has a demon in her. So I just log her, I go, What's your name on clean spirit? Boom, she just manifests, all prideful looking around, and then I'm like, okay, it's go time. So I'm like, in Jesus' name, and I'm trying to cast the demon out, and and and she can't speak because I'm trying to have her confess her sins, and she can't talk, and the Holy Spirit goes, the demons has their mouth locked, shut. So I go, in Jesus' name, I command you to open your mouth. And her mouth was released because there's power in the name of Jesus, and then we were trying to cast it out, and I don't know what was going on. Why was it coming out? So then I'm starting, I start telling her the gospel and all the stuff, and then the Holy Spirit goes, This demon is telling her that everything you're saying is a lie. So I go, is this demon telling you everything I'm saying is not true? She says, Yes. How do you know this? I said, Because the Holy Spirit is telling me what's going on with this whole situation. Then basically what happens from there, the other pastor gets a word of knowledge, and he looks at her and he goes, Hey, did this demon tell you you were gonna become rich through prostituting your body? And she looked, and she's 15 years old, and she looks and goes, How do you know this stuff? I go, I go, girl, you've been deceived. This demon has told you to prostitute your body to be rich. I go, you've been deceived. She goes, What do I do? I go, you need to confess your sins and repent and give your life to Christ. So I let her in the prayer, she confessed her sins, and then I just to see if the demon was you know still in her. I said, In Jesus' name, uh, you know, like unclean spirit, leave, or are you or what did I say? I said, in Jesus, uh, oh, I said, What's your name on clean spirit? Just to see if it would manifest nothing. And she goes, I was forgiven. I go, how do you know you were forgiven? She says, I saw my whole life pass before me, and then I saw it get covered in blood, and then it became white, because with the blood that was shed on the cross, she become white as snow. God gave her a vision right there on the spot. And guess what? She's been going to our church ever since, and she's all good. And that's what happens because greater is he that's in us than he that is in the world. So if you want to see the name of Jesus have authority in your prayer life, there must be a full surrender out in public and behind closed doors when no one's looking around. Take note of this. The heart and the mind is the battleground that Satan wants to control. You know that you know what I told you guys about the Navy SEAL, it's a war, it's a war, he's a war machine, but you get his mind and he's useless. That's what Satan wants to do. He wants to get our minds, so he cripples us. So we must be filled with the Holy Spirit, and to be filled with the Holy Spirit. What does that mean anyway? Be filled with the Holy Spirit. What does that mean? To be filled with the Holy Spirit means to be controlled by the word of God. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be controlled by the Word of God, and the Holy Ghost will destroy everything that is holy, because Jesus says, I will give you the torrent. A torrent is a violent force, streaming force of anything. The power from heaven, the torrents of living water will come down and destroy whatever is in your life if you open yourself and allow him to do it. But how can we be filled with the Holy Spirit? Simple. Read, pray, and obey. Read, pray and obey. Read the Bible, your your God's voice is speaking to you. Pray, your community came back to him, and then be obedient and through the Holy Spirit, he will help you through the power of the Spirit in your life that he will dominate over the flesh. And I'll say it again in case someone else is here that's new. And you hear God's voice when you read the Bible, and you say, Well, I never heard God's voice. Read the Bible out loud, and now you heard God's voice. Read it out loud. Ephesians 5 18 says this. It's a classic verse about being filled. It says this, don't be drunk with wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit. Now, I used to drink a lot. Yeah, debauchery, definitely for sure. I've never heard any good stories about drinking, okay? Now, you know, people are like, Well, let's see how close I can get with drinking and be a Christian. Not don't get drunk, a little tipsy there, better get rolled back a little bit, you know. Anyway, I think this verse is a lot bigger than just being drunk. Because what's other words for drunk? Filled, intoxicated under the influence. I think you could be filled, intoxicated under the influence with anger, bitterness, unforgiveness, rage, pornography. You could be under the influence and consumed with your job. There's a million different things, money, like whatever it is, you could literally be intoxicated and under influence with music you're listening, stuff you're watching, and then you remember that old saying, garbage in, garbage out, parted potty food, sewage water in, pour-potty sewage water out. So do not be drunk with wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit. That verse is actually caught talks about being continuing to be filled with the Holy Spirit. And when you're under the power of the Holy Spirit versus alcohol, or any of these other things I mentioned, the Holy Spirit is constructive versus these other things are destructive. And I want to look at uh Galatians 5 talks about the fruits of the spirit versus the fruits of the flesh. I'm gonna read them to you really quick, just as a reminder, because I know you guys have them all memorized. All right, fruits of the flesh, sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft, pharmacia, drugs, and stuff like that, hatred, discord, jealousy, rage, selfish ambition, dissension, envy, drunkenness. And there's this one thing, yeah. I'm not gonna say it now because I see a kid right there, but uh, and then there's fruits of the spirits, which are the opposite love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. How do you do this? Well, Jesus made it very simple. You reap what you sow. If you go after the things of the flesh, you're gonna reap the flesh, and they're not good. But if you go after things of the spirit, you're gonna reap the things of the spirit. But when you're filled with the Holy Spirit, your heart and mind and behaviors will change in public behind closed doors when no one's looking around. Because you will become a new creation in Christ. All the old things will pass away, and all things will become brand new. Jesus gave us that illustration of the tree. A good tree produces good fruit, a bad tree produces bad fruit. If a good tree produces bad fruit, chop it down and throw it into the fire, is what he says. Now, I'm I'm no, you know, the tree represents a person, and the uh the fruit repres represents people's actions. Now, I'm no farmer, okay? But God called me to Idaho recently to work on a project. So we built a uh, you know, we got a little garden little farm thing going on over here, planted a couple trees, and you know what? We get these really amazing trees, right? And they got these amazing apples and peaches, and they're amazing because the tree gets the perfect amount of sun, it has good soil, and it gets good water, and it produces amazing fruit. The tree produces amazing fruit. Now, if I were to give it porta potty sewage water, and it planted in the shade, and it's on in mud or you know, not good soil, it will produce bad fruit. That is our lives as believers. If we are in the word of God, because the word of God is the manna for today, it feeds our spirit, it feeds us, and then we get the living water from heaven, and then we spend enough time with the Son of God, you produce amazing fruit. It's literally that simple. But Why do we make it so hard? Because we're humans. Now, let's get back to talking about the power of the Holy Spirit. Romans 8:11 says this. The Spirit of God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead lives in you. And just as God raised Jesus Christ from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by the same spirit living within you. Now we're talking about resurrection power, raising the dead power. So we have the power of the eternal God indwelling in us. And he is with us, his power will come upon us and flow through us. And we will be able to stand against all the strategies of the devil and his plans to destroy our lives. How? Ephesians 6, be strong in the Lord and his mighty power. Jesus Christ is the Lord. He is the creator. Be strong in him. He's the Lord of heaven's armies. And Yahweh is his name. He is a warrior and he will fight for you. And his mighty power, the power is the Holy Spirit that raised him from the dead. Put on all of God's armor, not a piece, not some, all of God's armor. Then you will be able to stand firm against all the strategies of the devil. For we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies, but against evil rulers, the authorities of the unseen world against mighty powers in the dark world, against evil spirits in the heavenly places. Now, what are the strategies of the devil? That's what it says. What are they? Well, they're his names. So he's the serpent, Lucifer, Satan, the accuser, the tempter, the evil one, the liar, the devil, the murderer, the thief, the prince of this world, the God of this age, the prince of this age, and the ruler of the air, enemy, destroyer, dragon, accuser, deceiver. Those are this. And then I'm gonna throw in just for born bonus points. What are his voices? Here's just some of them. Obsesses, worries, condemns, discourages, confuses, pushes, frightens, rushes. But God's voice calms, comforts, convicts, encouraged, enlightens, leads, reassures, and still. Those are the difference. So how do you do it? How do you resist the devil against all of his strategies? Be strong in the Lord and his mighty power and keep on all the armor, not some. First John 4, 4 says, You are of God, little children, and I have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. And I will prove it to you. We got um, we had an opportunity to go down to uh Puerto Vallarta, and we went on gay pride week, and I didn't know. I had West Hollywood in my plane when I went down there. Now when I arrived, it's just going off. We're going through the schools, and all of our the government officials, because I was telling you this, some of you guys on Sunday, that my dad's born in Mexico City. So now when I go down there, the God's just opened the doors to all of Mexico, and we go into all the schools, and and just it's just amazing. Mandatory gospel. It's not even like you can't do that there, but it happens. So all these guys are gay and girls, and they invite us. Uh they they're escorting us to all the schools. At first, they're all worried about us, and then one of our ambassadors, she used to be gay in the in the in the movement, she got saved. So we're witnessing them, we're praying well with them. They then fall in love with us, right? And they go, hey, Ryan, we we're doing all the gay pride events downtown on the beach. They go, last night we did the the drag show at the amphitheater. They go, Do you guys want to do a whoosoever event down there? We're like, Yeah, let's go. So we're like, we're gonna need some more sound because we had a DJ with us, right? Uh, electronic DJ. So we go, we're gonna have to pump up some sound. So we go there and we we put beef up the sound, and all of a sudden I hear the song start dance with the devil. Let the demons out. And I'm like, what's going on right now? Like, this is like kind of a gnarly song to start our outreach with. I'm like, is this our DJ? Well, we went through about seven layers of letting demons out and dancing with the devil, and then finally our DJ is like, okay, I'm ready, I'm plugged in. So that was the guy we hired. He had that for our our outreach and in in the in the gay pride um uh festival. So, and I'm like, I don't care, we carry the Holy Spirit, we change atmospheres here. You know what I mean? Like, like there's no light in it, there's no darkness, you know, in God. So we we went, we played, we started the music, the whole place filled. Boom, the whole amphitheater, and it's all rainbow behind us. Like they got the whole kit, right? And this is happening. I get up, I preach the gospel. I said, if you I repent, if you need want to come to Jesus, come forward. The whole stage fills. I'm praying. We pray for the people, we lead them to the Lord. So then after, I feel a slap on my leg, and it's Tom, he's one of our ambassadors, he's a pro-storewater. He hits me and he's like, hey, there's a girl that's manifesting, demon-possessed in the crowd in the amphitheater. So I jump off the stage, I'm like, Satan's not ruined this party. So I go off the stage, I walk over, and we're there with Calvary Chapel Porta Vallarta, the pastor, uh, the wife, and then some of the guys from Calvary Chapel San Jose are there on mission, and they're holding this girl, and she's just wigging out, ha, manifesting. And I pray, you know, demon-possessed people, I pray with my eyes closed. I'm like, you know, because they'll spit on you, they'll bite you, they're all kinds of stuff. You don't know, I don't trust them. My dad has some crazy stories too. So I'm like, you know, in Jesus' name. And anyway, we cast the demon out of that girl, and it turns out she was a witch. And when the music happens, she said after, she says, something told me to go over here. So basically, we preach, and during the worship, she just manifested. And guess what? That same manifestation happened last the in Calvary Chapel Ellicott, too. The pastor also there, we were in the middle of the uh an event, and and some girl manifested and they had to take her out during worship. So this stuff happens, and and that girl got set free also. So this stuff happens, it happens all the time, but the power of God. That's enough demon stories. I have more, but we got to get into other stuff as we kind of wrap up here to go into worship. So, check out my podcast and just look up our tour stories. If you want to hear all these amazing stories that God does all around the world, just go to my podcast. It's all there for you guys. Okay, so now that we've identified who the Holy Spirit is, he is the spirit of truth and the power that God uses to get his work done through believers that have a relationship with Jesus, and the Holy Spirit gives us spiritual gifts to encourage the church to reach people for Christ. First Corinthians chapter 12, verses 4 to 11 says this. There is different kinds of gifts, but the same spirit is the source of all them. There are different kinds of services, but that we serve the same Lord. God works in different ways, but is the same God who does the work in all of us. And what I was saying, um, well, I didn't say it actually here, but you know, when we're asking for the gifts of the Spirit, God gives us the gifts as he chooses, right? He's the gift giver, and these are the gifts that we that help us lead people to Christ. Because who cares if you heal someone and they don't repent and give their life to Christ, you got a healed sinner on the highway to hell. The whole point is that you lead people to Jesus Christ. So now, for instance, I get words of knowledge, okay? I'm a hearer. I hear or I get prompted from the Holy Spirit, and I'll I'll get words like that. My friend, for instance, Christina, she gets words, but she gets pictures, and she says what she sees, or she gets visions, and she says what she sees. That's the way she gets words. So you might have the gift of like word of knowledge or something, and you're like, oh, how come I don't have visions? You probably are hearer, so you have to tune your heat your ears to the Holy Spirit. The purse of the Holy Spirit, he's in you. He's always speaking, he's giving us promptings. So there's different operations of the gifts, how they work. Okay. With that said, we're like the X-Med with special abilities, right? But we have a much greater cause. We are helping lead people out of the kingdom of darkness and transferring them into the kingdom of light. And this is why we have these tools, these giftings, these operations in our life, and God does it when he wants, and how he does it, we're just the vessel. Now the question is are we a vessel that is holy, saved, repented, and filled with the Holy Spirit with clean water, or are we a vessel of porta potty sewage water at three o'clock in the morning? You're like, God, use me. He's like, Well, I don't know about that. I don't do that. See what I'm saying? I was at uh Calvary Chapel Vista. I do my Calvary Chapel stories when I'm here in the revival night, so it's relatable. I was at Calvary Chapel Vista, and uh I got invited to this uh we were doing a skate park outreach, and then I got invited to a purity conference because they said they had pizza. So we went after, and um we were in there, and I was talking to the pastor outside, and it was a big like outdoor area with a bunch of chairs for lunch, and um, I felt like the Holy Spirit kept just like nudging me, like, look right, look right. So I'm like, looking right, I'm talking, I'm looking right, and I look over, and I see crutches, and I'm like, hey, I'm gonna be right back. So I walk over the crutches, and I'm like, whose crutches are these? And this girl's like, they're mine. And I'm like, what happened? And she pulls her leg out, she has a full brace all the way down. And I go, What happened? She goes, I was playing high school basketball Friday night, which is the night before. I jumped up, I came down, and the girl in front of me came down on my knee and tore my ACL, blood clots, and sprained something else. And I said, Are you in pain? And she's like, Yeah, we just got back from the doctor's last night. And I said, Well, I'm gonna pray for you. And she's like, Cool. I'm like, Well, I'm gonna pray that you're gonna get healed. And she's like, I'm like, Well, I go, Can I touch your legs? She's like, Yeah, I'm. The Bible says, like, lay hands on. So can I pray for you? And I just said, in Jesus' name, I just pray you heal her, no more pain in Jesus' name. And then all of a sudden she just starts crying. And I'm like, she's like, all the pain. I go, is all the pain going away? And she's like, yeah, it's all going away. And I'm like, I go, Jesus loves you. And I go, what's your story anyway? Because I'm not even supposed to be here right now. And God highlighted you and I prayed, and He just did that. And that's nothing for God, but clearly something's going on with you. And he she goes, you know, she says, I just feel like God hasn't seen me for years. And I've been praying too. Sorry, I'm just getting emotional, man. Cause I it breaks my heart when you see these kids that are just, you know, they're they don't feel like the God's around or God sees them. And I said, Listen, I said, God sees you. I go, I wasn't supposed to be here. I just came here, and then God highlighted you, and I came home and I prayed, and He did that, and I said, He loves you. So she leaves, so I go anyway. I go, well, I go DM me uh after you go to the doctors, and they tell you it's like you're totally healed and all that. So she hits me up a week later. She went to the doctors on Monday, and then um, supposedly, uh, she went to the doctors and DM'd me and said, you know, she says, we went to the doctors, got the x-rays, and the doctor's like, we can't believe this. We're looking at this x-ray, we're looking at this way. What happened? She goes, Jesus. They're like, okay, that's nice. What happened? So anyway, so then I I DM the pastor, and I'm like, hey, that girl DM me, and um, you know, she she also said that she went to basketball the next Friday and testified to her whole school in the you know, the the people in the basketball place that she got healed and played. So I DM the pastor, I go, hey, remember that girl? Look at this. Is the story? He's like, I know she's here at my church running around right now, she's not on crutches. I said, No one told me. So it's it's this is the power and the operations of the girl. There was this other atheist girl in Montana, and and we were like doing this parking lot, all these troubled kids we walked up to, and and and one guy, he was there smoking his cigarette, and I'm like, hey, did you hear what I said over there? He's like, No, I don't believe in God blank cussing, bike blank blank, and then the Holy Spirit's like, pray for his knee, and I'm like, what's wrong with your knee? And he's like, Oh, I messed it up, this and that. And I look at the girl with them. I go, isn't he messed up? She's like, he's like, yeah, I heard it doing this. And I go, I go, I'm gonna prove it right now that God's really like in Jesus' name. I pray that your knee be gets healed. Boom. And he's like, what? Blankety blank blank blank. What? And then he's like, I can't believe this. And the girl's like smoking her cigarette, and she's like a little white gangster girl. She's like, What? Like, no way, there's no way, no way. And I'm like, and I'm like, well, what's your deal? And I I don't get any information on her, so I was just like, well, what's your deal? I'm like, she's like, I'm an atheist, I don't believe in God. And I go, why? And she's all because there's just so much wrong in the world and you know, good and evil, and this and I go, that's fair, that's fair. And I said, Well, is there anything wrong with you? I go, is there anything wrong with you? She goes, I can't lift my arm. I go, what do you mean? She goes, I can only lift my arm like that. I go, You can't lift it up. She goes, No. So I called Sonny, the lead singer of POD over, and I go, Hey, come over and pray for arm. God's gonna heal our arm right now. And then he's like, What? No, he's all scared. He goes, He's like, I don't want to look stupid. I'm like, who cares? So he comes over and he prays for her arm, and then he goes, in Jesus' name, and then she goes like this, and she's like, No, no, no. And then after, basically, what happens is she leaves, she tells us a story. She hasn't been able to lift her arm uh since sixth grade. And we told the the these other group of kids as she walked away. Sonny's like, we he's like, I just prayed for that girl's arm, and God healed her. And they're like, that girl, they go, she hasn't been able to lift her arm since sixth grade. Because God, and and what do we do after she got healed? I go, what you know what else you need? I go, you want more? She says, Yes. I said, say this prayer, Jesus, forgive me my sins. And then I pray that she got filled with the spirit, and I and she got filled, and that was a wrap because that's what the gifts of the operation are for. You can clap for that one. And I'll close with this. There's different spiritual gifts. There's the gift of helps, the gift that gives wise advice, wisdom, the gift of special knowledge, words of knowledge. Um, the spirit gives faith. It gives the gift of healing, the ability to perform miracles, the ability to prophesy, to discernment, to discern things. Um, it's also gives uh the gift of tongues, which is unknown languages, and then interpretations. So these are the different gifts that are some of them that Christ can give us through the power of the Holy Spirit. So this was I said, this is the Holy Spirit night. So this is the thing. The question is, why do you come? The what would you come for? Do you this is a night to be filled with the Holy Spirit to want more of God to read what you read in the Bible? Like I read it, and I'm like, you can do that. I'm like, let's do this, right? So we read it, we believe it, but we need our active faith. Faith is believing in something that you don't see, but you're counting on God to do it, but there's no pressure because I can't do anything. I can't do anything. You can't do anything. It's God doing the extraordinary in the or with ordinary people, and what does it come down to? He's not looking for perfect people, he's not looking for perfection, he's looking for direction. What is your direction? The direction should be heading to the cross. Deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow me, Jesus says. He says, if you try to hang on to your life, you're gonna lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you're gonna save it. And what does the man profit if he gains the whole world and he loses his own soul? Is there anything worth more than his soul? There is nothing worth more than your soul. Listen, I've been working in the music and skateboard industry my whole life and continue. I'm backstage, and I'm meeting with these artists that are going up on stage and they're talking about doing drugs, this, that, that, and then they're backstage, they're eating their zandy bars, they got their shrink on the call, and they're in the middle of a divorce, and they're miserable, but they'll go up and they'll tell you all this stuff from stage. It's all image, it's not real. What will man give for his soul? That's the question tonight. What is it in your life? What was it in my life? Mine is I like chasing girls and smoking and drinking and partying. That was it. That's what I chase. Emptiness, shiny objects. What is it in your life that you are putting in front of Christ? Christ needs to be number one in your life. Seek ye first, the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added. Everything. God created you. He knit you together in your mother's room. There's only one of you. There's only ever gonna be one of you, and you were designed for specific plan and purpose here on earth. All your giftings, all your talents, everything that you're into. I love skateboarding and fishing. Dude, I love it. Guess what? It's not like, oh yeah, I just I just like got into it. God put that in me. And I used to think, oh, if I give my life to Jesus, my life's gonna be lame, boring. No way, I'm doing more than I've ever have. I'm clear-minded, I'm sober-minded, I'm connected to the most high God in heaven, that Wi-Fi connection. He's giving me downloads, he leads me, he guides me. Red light, green light. He's he's always speaking to me. I'm not perfect, like I said, but I just need to head to the cross, just like you, and that's what revival night is. What do you want to do? What are you gonna do with Jesus? What do you do with the power? What do you do with Father of God? The three and one tonight. That is the question. And I already know you want more. That's why you came. So I'm gonna call the band out, and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go into a worship session. And now this is just the time of responding to the Holy Spirit. I'm gonna have everyone stand up. We're gonna, this is the time that as we sing, just talk to the Holy Spirit, talk to God, and just whatever it is, sing, worship. And as we sing, we're just gonna go to a deep time of worship and just allow the Holy Spirit just to respond to you guys individually. That's what's amazing. That He will answer questions that He will speak to you and all these good things. So let's just go ahead and we're gonna just uh we're just gonna sing and I'm gonna have someone grab this um pulpit for me. Please, and let's sing. Awesome, thanks, guys. Everybody, this is my sandwich. And here is where I lay down every eye in every time. This is my sermon. And I will make all you to do whatever you want. Whatever you want. And now we'll make every to do whatever you want. Whatever you want. And here is where I down. Every word in every crowd. This is my surrender. This is my surrender. This is my servant. Whatever you want. And now I'll make her you to do whatever you want. Whatever you want. Whatever you want. And now we'll make help for you to do whatever you want. Whatever you want. There's people here that have not given their life to Jesus ever. And you maybe been brought here by a friend. Dude, that's amazing. You're here tonight. And you might be just dealing with emptiness or just cares of the world. I don't know what's going on in your life. But there's something inside of us that we cannot fill. And it's only the Holy Spirit could empty could feel that empty place in our life. And we try to fill it with the things. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, the pride of life, possessions, assets, money, jobs, careers, the beautiful girl, the guy, whatever, material things, and you think, and you know if that's you, you know, that that doesn't, that never fills it. Or whatever it could be in your life. Maybe you're dealing with addiction. And that my film is spoke to you. Whatever is going on in your life tonight. And maybe you're just, you know, I'm like, I'm a I'm a pretty good person. I don't really have much going on, but you have that empty void in your life. You need Jesus Christ tonight. Today is the day you're not here by accident. God has a plan for you, and you're never too old to give your life to Christ, and God could use you at any time. So as we sing this song, and you want to give your life to Christ, I want to pray for you. Because many of us, but the majority of us are here that we've done that. And it's the cool thing, but I want to activate your faith tonight to step out by faith. And as you come up here, I want to lead you in a prayer to so you could ask for forgiveness of your sins and be filled with the Holy Spirit, and you can start that new spirit-led life, and God can activate you and show you who you are. Your identity is in Christ. When you find out who your identity is in Christ, that's where you become secure. Because you're always trying to mimic, like, oh, I'm this band, oh, I'm the style, I'm this, and you find all these identities, right? Of all this brokenness. Your identity's in Christ. He designed you, and that's what it's about. And there's gonna be people here also that have come tonight that have walked away from the Lord. For maybe you're in a crazy season and you're going through these things, and you got off course, and you need to get back on the straight and narrow. We know that Jesus says the highway to hell is broad, and the gates are wide, the road is wide, but the gateway to eternal life to heaven is narrow and few ever find it. Jesus also said, if you're f yeah, if you're not for me, you're against me. Because you believe by say, well, I'm cool with Jesus, I believe him, it's all good. You know, but believing is not enough. And James says, even the demons believe, and they tremble. You have eternal life starts at the cross. You can't escape it. You have to give it all, surrender all, and repent. Repent means to flip a U-turn. So we're gonna sing this song and just come forward if you need to give your life back to the Lord or give your life to the Lord for the first time. And you just gotta get right with God. This is what revival night's about. We're gonna sing, and you just come up here and respond in Jesus' name. Shake of the ground of all my tradition, break down the worms of all my religion spell Cause your way is better, shake up the ground, all my tradition, break down the wrongs of all my religion, makes better, because you'll wait. Shake up the ground of all my tradition, break down the wands of all my shake up the ground of all my tradition, break down the walls of all my child, whatever you want, whatever you want, and now we'll make her now to do whatever you want, whatever you want, everywhere you now will make her to do whatever you want, whatever you want, and now we'll make help. People are still coming down. We're gonna keep singing. This is amazing. The Holy Spirit is speaking. If your heart is beating fast, God is knocking, but we have to open ourselves to him. We're gonna continue to sing rightly, and as the Holy Spirit continues to speak, just respond. This is why we're here. This is the hospital, and we're here to get bandaged up and allow God to touch our lives. So let's sing and respond. I know there's more. Come and respond to the Holy Ghost. Keep coming. As the Holy Spirit speaks to you, respond. This is why we're here. I'm gonna pray for you. Even if you're up here in the back, right on, they're just seeing another one. That's they're good, they're still coming. Cause you are the worthy of it all from you unalles, and to you unlock things, because you deserve the glory. Awesome. Cause you worthy of it, because you worthy of the law things, and to you uncuse you deserve the glory. We're gonna wait, they're still coming down. Just keep singing and just keep responding. Up here now, I see him. Respond the Holy Spirit is doing this. The Lord is speaking to you through the Holy Spirit. He wants to do it. He's touching people's lives right now. God is moving by his spirit on your hearts, and he's revealing you. And he's drawing you to Jesus. Go for it, Riley I didn't take sense. I want to pray. That was that was amazing. I saw the last person just come down before I pray. If there's any last person, and when I was up here, I heard the word greed. So that's for somebody. Today's the day. God sees you, whoever that is, it could be multiple, I don't know, but greed. That could be what's holding you back from the kingdom and putting that in front of God. And today's the day that you need to repent, repent, and turn to Christ. This is what revival night's about. It's about getting right with God. And you're responding to the Holy Spirit. So we're gonna say this prayer out loud, and we're gonna continue to go into worship and keep going deep. We're gonna say this prayer. I'm gonna lead you in it in this prayer. Just say this after me, and we're all gonna say it because we are all whosoevers. Say, Jesus, please forgive me of all my sins. I want to accept you as my Lord and my Savior. Fill me with the Holy Spirit, fire and power. Wash me with the blood that was shed on the cross, making me white as snow. In Jesus' mighty name. Amen. Now we're gonna continue to worship. Let's continue to worship Riley. Take us more into worship. And I would encourage you guys now that now we're all forgiven. We're all white as snow. I want to keep taking an uncomfortable place. And I would ask you to raise your hands as our white flags in worship to God. In worship, I'm gonna take you out of your comfort zone. Everyone lift their hands to the sky in awe and fear of the Lord in awe of Lord. And we surrender, and let's sing this song, and let's just allow the Holy Spirit to fall upon us in worship. I desire anything that is not of you, but is I want more of you unless me holy fire I decide for anything holy fire I desire for anything that is not you but is um me I want more of you and less love me I want more of you there is some I want more of you and less me in me with you with you good feeling with you with you with you with you five down in my soul that can contain it I can control I want more of you I want more of you God down in vessel that I can contain that I can control I want more of you God I want more you guys singing I want more of you God I want more of you God down in my soul that I can contain that I can control I want more of you God I want more I want more I want more I want more of you God I want more of you God I want more I want more I want more I want more of you God I want more of you God Since we're singing, we want more. I'm gonna pray for more. Lord, Father God in heaven, I pray in Jesus' name. I ask that you will open the torrents of the living water, the reservoir living water, and pour outon this place as we are singing it. We are believing, and we know a supernatural event happens when we believe, Lord, that you will give us the torrents we have not because we ask not. So Lord, I pray for the fire and the baptism of your spirit, Lord, submerge every single person that is in here, Lord, so they have the power for service, Lord, to be that father that you've created them to be, to be that mother that they've created to be in the in the children and teenagers and young adults. They have they need that power to live in this world and to be who you created to be, Lord. I pray in Jesus' name for ones that are dealing with the mental health crisis. That there's any doors that have been opened to the supernatural realm to the dark side from them watching and believing this stuff and opening the doorways. I pray in Jesus' name, and I rebuke any demonic activity in their lives. Go back to hell where you've come from in Jesus' name, and I pray in Jesus' name that you will seal them, seal them shut with the Holy Spirit and cover them with the blood of Jesus. Now, Lord, cover us with the blood of Jesus, and I pray, Holy Spirit, that you will illuminate their mind and you will renew their mind, renew their heart, give them new life, those ones that have that heaviness of depression and anxiety and fear in Jesus' name. I pray, just like you heal Mike Macintosh in the hippie moment when he thought his head was blown off from all the LSD he took, he was fried, but you did it in a service and you healed them. So I ask in the mighty name of Jesus for a healing touch for those ones that are dealing with mental stuff, depression, anxiety, fear, whatever is holding them down that the enemy has. So we believe that you can do it because you're the same yesterday, today, and forever, and Jesus, we're gonna hold you to your word. So Lord, I also pray for people that are here for the gift of faith. We can't do anything without faith. So I ask in Jesus' name that you will implant as they have that faith, but that you will raise that faith, that you will magnify it, that you will grow that faith in their life. I also pray in Jesus' name that you will release the gifts of the spirit that you have for them so that they have these abilities as they leave, that they can use them out there in the world to lead people to Christ. Lord, we ask that you will do it as you choose. I also pray for every single person in here that is in a marriage. I pray for marriages to be whole. We pray any division from people or the enemy that is in, we rebuke that now, leave now in Jesus' name and Lord, do the work, just come together in that marriage in unity, Father God, and I pray for the prodigals in Jesus' name as I was a prodigal, Lord. Keep them safe in Jesus' name, but bring them home in your timing, but keep them safe, Lord. We we pray and we want so bad for that to happen, Father God, and I pray in Jesus' name, Lord. We ask for more of the Holy Spirit as we continue to worship. I pray you will continue to baptize us more, continue just flowing from our head to our feet, the torrents of the living water, the power as we respond to you, and as we sing this next song, ask the Holy Spirit, because He's in you. Ask him if there's things in your life that are holding you back, and there might be something you can't even think of, but the Holy Spirit will he'll give you that, he'll show you, and as we worship, just repent of those things. So there's nothing holding you back tonight from what God wants to do. Let's continue to worship rightly Hallelujah, because we sing Hallelujah, because we sing Hallelujah for the Lamb is overcome Cause we sing Hallelujah Cause we sing Hallelujah Cause we sing Hallelujah for the Lamb is overcome Cause we sing Hallelujah Cause we sing Hallelujah Cause we sing Hallelujah for the Lamb is over here sing Hallelujah We sing Hall of Yeah in the heat is God in his heart is a leg in hand He is He is a love Because we sing Hunger Cause we sing Hungry Hunger So we see Hunger Please Honey Sound God is overcome Jesus you have overcome the Lamb is overcome because your name is the highest your name is the greatest name stands above the law all thrones into men's all power and position your name stands above the law and Jesus your name is the highest unless is the greatest your name stands above them all thrones into means of our and position your name stands above the law and the angels cry all creation you will lift it high To the king of you is a highest greatest you name stands above the mark of bones into means all palm and positions you'll lay sands above the wall and Jesus above the law all through late stands above the law and the angel cry of creation to the kingdom man. I'm just like blown away by what the Holy Spirit's doing right now. God is so amazing and what he's doing here in this room tonight. Thank God for what he's doing in you and what he's gonna do through you. Like my father in law tells me when I go to Kawhi, and he takes me to the waterfalls and all these hidden spots. He always goes, and there's so much more. Hey, there's so much more. There's so much more. There's one prayer I want to say before we do this last song. Um I I had a request, and it's something that I always pray about, but it's about alcohol and drugs. So I need to pray for those people here, because it's a huge thing. Lord, in Jesus' name, I pray for everyone here and beyond that are dealing with drugs and alcohol and pornography and pills and everything in that vein. In the mighty name of Jesus, we ask, Holy Spirit, that you will touch their lives today, just like you touched my life nineteen years ago, and I never went to a rehab, it was just done over. Tonight, we ask in Jesus' name that all the desires, all the cravings will go in Jesus' mighty name. Amen. We're gonna do one last song as an ender song. We're gonna I'm gonna have Austin come up, I believe, or Gary, one of you, Boston, we're gonna have Austin come up, and then we're gonna do uh baptisms. Uh listen, okay, yes, yes, you might have not come to get baptized, but you might go home baptized. Water baptism is when you said I'm sold out for God, I'm done, not perfect, I'm gonna make mistakes, but you go into the water, the water represents the grave, you leave the old person, the old you in there, and you come up out of the water, and as the water is coming off you that represents the holy spirit, the living water, the spirit-led life that you're gonna walk out living. We're gonna dunk you guys tonight, young and elderly. So let's do this last song, and then Austin's gonna come up and he's gonna close it out. I I love you guys. Thank you. This is our first East Coast stop. Thank you. Or we can weekend. We're gonna sing this last song together to thank God for what he did tonight.
