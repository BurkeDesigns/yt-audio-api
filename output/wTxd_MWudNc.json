  "transcript": "God has entrusted those children to you and has promised to give you everything you need to raise them. Sometimes we just need to ask for his help. Today we're going to talk about fatherhood. And our scripture for the day is in Ephesians. If you want to turn there, Ephesians chapter 6, verse 4, and we're going to look at a couple different versions of translations from Ephesians 6 4, the ESV, New King James, NIV, some different versions. But the one I've chosen for today to read from is the ESV. Paul is talking to the church, the Christians in Ephesus. And he says, Fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. So before we continue, let's let's go ahead and pray. God, we thank you for the opportunity that we have to be here today. We just take a deep breath and try to remember why we're here. We've had an opportunity to worship you, and now we want to hear from you from your word. And so we just willfully and humbly open our hearts and our minds to what you have to share with us. Maybe it's through a scripture verse. Maybe it's just through your Holy Spirit, just reminding us of something that you've told us. But we want to hear from you today. And so we are here. We give you the next few minutes as we listen, because we know it's important, because we know you're good, and you are the perfect heavenly father. So we want to listen to your word today in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, I want to honor my dad on Father's Day. He's here for the service today. And so I'm thankful for him. My dad played some college football and spent some time in the Air Force and spent some time in the CIA. But his most important role was obviously as my baseball and football coach growing up. And so thankful for my dad. He was very involved, uh loving father, loyal to his three kids, uh, married 62 years. And uh so I'm thankful for him. Um my dad was also the strictest dad that I knew. Maybe some of you can relate. Yet you your dad was the strictest dad in your in your class, no matter what class in school it was, um, no matter what team you were on, no matter what your youth group looked like. My dad was always the strictest, uh, most involved. Um, I remember as a coach, um, I was playing baseball, and I slid into third base head first, and um my hand got um underneath the uh third baseman's metal spikes, and uh so my hand was bleeding, and uh so as the coach, he calls time out, brings me a cup of water, and uh I go to drink the water, he's like, No, it's for your hand. He put puts my hand in the water to rinse off the dirt, pulls it out, goes back to the dugout, and we continue the game. And uh so I just remember the word the worst part was putting on my glove on that on that hand to go out for the next inning. And so my dad was old school, he was old school before old school became any anything. Maybe some of you can relate with uh with your dads. But he expected a lot, a lot from himself, a lot from me as his only son. I mean, he was, I think the first from his family to graduate from high school, first one of his family to graduate from college, now he has a doctorate, and uh so I'm proud of him. And um, I guess the apple didn't fall too far from the tree because when you ask my kids to describe me, they'll say, very involved in the strictest dad on any anything, any team I've been on, any school that I've been on, any youth group that I've been on, my dad's always been the strictest, and so that's how my kids describe me as well. So I think I had a good childhood. I wish I remembered more. I actually have a pretty poor memory, um, maybe it's too many concussions, but for some reason, my wife knows more about my childhood than I do, and I didn't meet her until she was 20 years old. Um so I don't know if any of you fathers or husbands can relate. When my kids are asking me stories about my childhood, I look to my wife to confirm whether that was true or not, or whether that whether that happened, she'll come back from a family gathering, listen to a story, and just say, Yeah, that's crazy. I can't I didn't know that your parents housed this missionary at your house for a month, or or your cousin had her baby and came to stay with you for the summer. I was like, I yeah, I didn't know either. Um that's that's news to me as well. She's like, How did you not know you were like 12 or you were 14? How did you not know those things? I just don't, I don't necessarily remember. Um even my kids when they talk to me about different things that happened in their own childhood as their dad, they'll they'll remind me of things, and I'll look to my wife and be like, did that happen? Is that is that really? Did I really say that? Did I really do that? My wife would be like, Yeah, you actually did say that. So I think I I think I had a good childhood, as much as I can remember, wish I could remember more. I do remember things, they just need to be in like a photo album. When if I see it in a picture, I'm like, oh yeah, I remember that. I can I've seen that picture six times, and so I that gets glued in my memory. But uh it's it's interesting the things you remember. I remember um I was about 13 years old, striking out on an outside pitch by Keith Miller, and I was embarrassed, and I still remember striking out at 13, but there's so many other things about my childhood so much more important that I do not remember. So I was blessed to have a good dad. But even my dad would tell you, he he's not the example to follow. My dad made mistakes, my dad has regrets. Um, just like the rest of us. I don't know any dad in this room who's the expert. There are no experts when it comes to fatherhood. And so today we're gonna look into scripture to ask God for help. Because when we look in scripture, there's very few experts even in scripture. In fact, I think it's on purpose, because it drives us to realize and recognize that our heavenly father really is the only father for us to look up to as an example. I mean, think about looking at leaders in scripture, even some of these men who were listed in the halls and the heroes of the faith in Hebrews 11. Think about starting even with Adam. I mean, think about Adam's first son Cain, killed his second son Abel. I mean, think about Noah, Noah's life after the flood. Noah cursed his grandson for his son's sin. Uh think about Abraham. Abraham had a son with his maidservant, and then he sent his maidservant and that son out into the desert. And then Abraham had another son, Isaac. Um, and Isaac's twin sons, Jacob and Esau were at odds from the moment that Jacob sold Isaac or Esau his uh birthright for a bowl of stew. So Esau asks uh for a bowl of stew, and Jacob says, Well, if you give me your birthright, I'll give you the bowl of stew. And they had been at odds ever since. And then Jacob had 10 sons before his favorite son was born, and that was a problem. And the ten sons send the 11th son, Joseph, into a pit and then into slavery, and then they go back and tell their dad that Joseph was dead. And think about then the priest that came later. The priest Eli had two sons. And the Bible says the priest was so busy traveling around to all the different regions in northern Israel that he didn't recognize that his sons were evil. The Bible called them scoundrels, and yet he tried to put them in in his place to be priests over the people, and the people rebelled. And then Eli raised Samuel. Think about the prophet and the judge Samuel who anointed King Saul and King David. Uh think about Samuel. Samuel tried to anoint his two sons to be prophets after him, and again, the people rebelled. The people said, We won't let your sons rule over us because they don't walk in the ways of the Lord like you do, Samuel. And then Gideon, the judge. Gideon had 70 sons. How do you raise and discipline 70 sons? Well, you don't. Gideon's one son from a concubine, had the other 69 sons killed because he wanted to be the only one that could serve in place of his father. And then think of David. King David also had the Bible says he also had 70 sons. And think about King David. One of his sons guilty of rape, one of his sons guilty of murder, one of his sons tried to take the throne away from him. One of his sons had seven hundred wives. So what can we learn from all these leaders in Scripture? Don't have sons. Right? Pray for daughters. Sons are trouble. No, we learn that some of the heroes of the faith even struggled to be fathers that God had called them to be. They did their best, and some of their children rebelled. And so we think about why do sons and daughters rebel? Why do our sons and daughters rebel? Why do they ignore our instruction? Why do they resist correction? It was because they're just like us. They have a human nature. And today sometimes we're too surprised or hurt by our kids' misbehavior, and we assume too quickly that we must have done something wrong. Maybe we have. But being a parent, and for today, more specifically, being a father, it's a difficult task. It's a challenge, but an important discussion. I mean, think about it, a sinful human beings, fathers are tasked with, are given the mission to raise, to train, to discipline, to bring up. In fact, that word bring them up in Ephesians 6 means to raise them to maturity. We're called to raise our children to maturity. And at the same time, trying to understand the difference between just a childish mistake and rebellion, the difference between just being A kid and willful disobedience. We try to raise little ones that don't want our help and yet they need it. Little ones that are always testing the nature and the limits of their freedom and they think they know best when they don't. And yet at the same time, we're trying to be a good dad. We're trying to raise our kids, trying to be a good husband, trying to work, trying to provide, fighting through traffic with lawn care and bills. And yet we're the ones called to be the example, the leader, the servant who is called to love like Christ. Thankfully, if we want help, there are over 60,000 books on Amazon right now that we could read on parenting. My favorite ones entitled, Parenting is Hard, and then you die. But when you think about parenting, I mean, even think about the parable of the prodigal son. I mean, this father had two sons, and the youngest decided, I want to leave my father's house, and I want my inheritance now. And so it is an insult for the youngest son to ask for his inheritance right now before his father's died. But the father gave it to him. He said, I want to take my inheritance, and he went in and he squandered all his father's inheritance. He went into the city, made a mess of things, got in trouble through sin, squandered everything, got to the point, got to the end, and then he came to his senses. The Bible says he came back to his father, repented, and his father welcomed him back with open arms. Do you ever read that story and assume that the responsibility for that son's sin is on the father? Or do you read that story and you realize, yeah, the son was attracted by sin, got caught up in it, got destroyed by it, and then came back into his loving father's arms and repented, just like our heavenly father does. Have you ever once just read that story and just thought, man, I wonder if the dad read one of those parenting books. Maybe his son wouldn't have left. Never. You never assume that. You always just assume. The parable's clear because of the human nature, because sin is attracted, this that sin is going to destroy us, and God is waiting with open arms if we would just repent. That's the parable of that story. And so after studying scripture, I've tried to find and narrow it down to five things that stand out to me what it means to be a loving father. Five different things that I found. And again, not pulling from a lot of experts in scripture, but looking at our heavenly father, trying to understand what are some different things that it looks like. What does it mean to be a loving father? And so here's the first four. A loving father provides and protects. And those first two are the most self-explanatory. A loving father provides and protects. A loving father provides for his family. A loving father brings some sense of safety to the home, some safety to the children. A loving father provides and protects. And then the third one teaches, a loving father's teaches. This goes back to that verse in Ephesians 6 4. Teaching is the word used in maybe in your Bible's admonition, or maybe in your Bible's instruction. This is the idea that a father, a good father, don't provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline or admonition of the Lord. So when it says admonition, it's basically saying teaching, instruction. Paul's making it clear that to fathers, hey, I don't want just the mothers or the youth pastors or the Sunday school teachers being the ones to teach your kids about Jesus. Fathers, I want you to do it. In Deuteronomy 4 in the Old Testament, Moses tells parents, hey, I want you to teach your kids, and sometimes I want you to do it with instruction, and sometimes I want you to do it through example, because we know sometimes things are more easily caught than taught. Listen to Moses from Deuteronomy 6.5. He says this. Love the Lord God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them upon your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up. In other words, he's saying, impress God's word on your children, and sometimes do it with example, and sometimes do it with words. The teaching aspect, the admonition aspect, the instruction aspect is assuming that we're doing this through words. A loving father teaches us his children. Now the leading aspect, the next one assumes that you're doing this through your example. Because kids need an example. Sometimes kids follow your example more than your advice. Ever recognize that? Sometimes they follow your example more than your advice. But a good father leads, a good father's a role model. A good father is an example. This takes maturity and sacrifice. I know for some of you who have really young kids, this takes a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes you have to think about maybe maybe the hunting trip, maybe the golf excursion, maybe the sports tournaments. Maybe you have to turn those down because I'm a parent with young kids, and I need to make a sacrifice, and I need to lead by example, and I need to be there. The mom needs me, the kids need me, and that especially in that season. In other words, until you can take them with you on your adventures, you might not have to say no to the adventures for this season. That takes sacrifice because leaders make decisions with the best interest of their family in mind. It's not that much different in business. What makes a good boss? What makes a good leader? The leader's making a decision with their coworkers' best interest in mind, with their organization's best interest in mind, with their employees' best interest in mind. And a good leader in the home makes a decision with his family's best interest in mind, with his wife and kids' best interest in mind. Make decisions and lead by example. And that's what leadership looks like in the home. And then the last trait, number five, by far the most common trait of a loving father when looking through scripture, is that a loving father is one who disciplines or trains his children. A loving father is one who disciplines or trains his children. Overwhelmingly, looking out throughout scripture, you could not miss the fact that a father is called to discipline or train his children. Most times when we think about discipline our kids, we think about the question of whether we spank our kids or not. We think about punishment. We think about consequences. The idea is in this passage, discipline is much more associated with correction, with training and with coaching than it is with discipline than it is with punishment or consequences. I mean, think about it. When we think of God's punishment in Scripture, it was the result of his wrath or his justice. When we think about God's discipline in Scripture, it's the result of his love. Bible says a loving father disciplines his children, and it has much more to do with correction, training, coaching than it does has to do with anything about punishment. Look at these verses from Proverbs. It says, He who loves his children is careful to discipline them in Proverbs 13. Proverbs 3 says, My son do not despise the Lord's discipline. Do not resent his rebuke because the Lord disciplines those he loves as a father, the son he delights in. We have to get past the idea of discipline as the idea of whether we spank or not. Fathers, if someone asks you if you discipline your kids, say yes every day. I discipline my kids every day. I train them, I teach them, I coach them, I guide them every day. In the New Testament, you can follow along. I'm going to read from Hebrews 12, verses 5 through 11. It says this, have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as fathers as a father addresses his son? It says, My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline. Do not lose heart when he rebukes you. Because the Lord disciplines the one he loves. So endure hardship as discipline. God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father. If you're not disciplined, and everyone undergoes discipline, then you're not legitimate, true sons or daughters at all. Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the father of spirits and live? Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best, but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. So if we look back to Ephesians 6 4, you look at the different verses with the translations. Don't provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord. Don't provoke your children to anger, bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Rather bring them up with discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord from the New Living Translation. See, Paul's instruction for Christian families, if we understand the context, Paul's talking to the Roman world. Ephesus was part of the Roman Empire at this time. And under the Roman Empire, there was in Latin, it was patria potestus. And it just means parents or fathers, especially, has the authority. Father is the boss. And so in that Roman culture, the father had the ability to even sell his kids into slavery if he needed the money. The father had the ability to impact every decision the child made, who he got married to, what job that he had, his employment, whether he was a slave or not, whether he lived or died, the father, it was patria potestus in Latin, life or death. It could impact their work, impacted their marriage, impacted their property. And it just didn't, it didn't change when the child became 18 or 21. It was until the father died. That's the culture that Paul was referring to. And so he's making sure that culture understood, and this was counterculture, his message. He's basically saying, hey, Christians in Rome, Christians in Ephesus. Children are not your property. Children are not your possessions. You're giving your children to To do the your best with, and I don't want you to provoke them to anger. I don't want you to provoke them to wrath by doing being too harsh, too strict, too stern, too much punishment as a domineering father. Because sometimes it impacted their marriage, their property, their livelihood. So Paul's assuming that there's parental authority, but is assuming that the readers needed to know how to use restraint. They needed to know how to use wisdom as the leaders of the family, warning them not to do more harm than good. In that era, Paul was warning them against too harsh of discipline. Sometimes in today's culture, you wonder if the discipline is enough. Do we do we warn fathers about not being involved enough or becoming too passive or becoming absent in their parenting? See, in today's culture, we assume if if fathers just get out of the way, the kids will grow up to be good. And yet we know in Scripture, the Bible says a child left to himself brings shame. We understand that parents need to be involved. But fathers are trying to find that balance because too much instruction can provoke or exasperate children. We understand that sometimes we, as parents, as dads, we talk too much. We explain too much. We reason too much with kids. Sometimes we reason with our kids and try them to make sure that they wait before they eat candy before dinner, and we're expecting our kids, our four-year-old to respond, oh, thank you, Father, for explaining that candy with the sugar and the and the red dyes, and it affects my gut health, and I appreciate your concern for my health and how I'm going to be grow up to be big and strong. And we expect an explanation, and so we reason with our kids. And sometimes we reason and explain too much. I mean, there's a time for it, but a certain age, sometimes the age is important, and other times the setting's important. You got a four-year-old going through the airport. You really don't have the time to explain to the four-year-old, hey, look, because you can't read, you're not gonna be able to find the gates, you're gonna have to stay with me, and it's easy to get lost, and then I'm on the plane, and then that would be that would be a tragedy. And so I need you to hold my hand, please. Will you please hold my hand if I reason with you and explain it enough? You see, sometimes because I said so is an appropriate response. Anyone else hear that growing up? You say to a four-year-old, you just need to hold my hand right now in the airport. I don't have time to explain it right now. And you realize that the number of explanations, and sometimes the expectation is, oh, they're they're gonna thank me. They're gonna appreciate all this explanation and all this instruction that they get, and the more we do it, sometimes exasperates our kids. And then they get older, and we have more time to explain it to them, and that's when become because I said so can exasperate our kids. So we realize, and I grew up on because I said so, and I realized there's a time and a place for it, and it and it can be good, but it's it's the setting, and it's the time to say that to a teenage boy about looking at pornography when there's probably time for it, and there's probably a good explanation to help the boy understand hey, God's design for your life and for intimacy with your future wife is through purity. That's the pathway that he's given to you. And you're learning things, you're learning self-control, and you're learning discipline that you'll use for the rest of your life, and as you, if you do, things will go good for you. But as Solomon said, he will die for lack of discipline led astray by his own great folly in Proverbs 5, referring to men without self-control. And so we understand sometimes there's times for explanation, but sometimes we can exasperate our kids. The words training or discipline that Paul used was most common with the Greek athletes. So you think of athletes. Think of the Greeks training for the Olympics. And he's using that word, you need to be trained, you need to be disciplined, and the athletes would understand. Yeah, I'm not gonna get trained or disciplined just because I go to because I go to one practice. I'm not gonna do one sprint and become a good sprinter. I'm not gonna do one jump and become a good jumper. I need consistency. I need a coach that offers feedback. I need correction, I need guidance. I need discipline, and the athletes understood they need consistency and examples and opportunities for practice. Kids need opportunities to practice as they grow. They need opportunities from a coach. Here's here's opportunities to practice. Because think about why. Is because instruction isn't enough to teach responsibility. You don't teach responsibility to your kids. You give your kids responsibility, you give them opportunities to be responsible. This is why kids need discipline. Instruction is just simply not enough. You can't teach your kids how to be responsible with simply giving them instruction. You have to give them responsibility. You give kids some responsibility. They feel the weight of that responsibility as a child and they recognize and they continue to grow and become more responsible as they grow because they have opportunities to do so at a young age. You don't teach patience. Instruction's not enough for patience. How many of us have have prayed? God, give me patience. And what does God say? Here, here's some patience right now. No, he says, wait. He gives us opportunities to learn patience. And as parents, we want our kids to teach patience. We understand the value of teaching our kids patience, but we just can't teach it with instruction. We can't exasperate our kids over and over again with instruction and instruction, instruction about patience. We have to give them opportunities to practice patience. We have to give them opportunities to wait. We can't give them everything that they want when they want it. You don't teach maturity. You can't take a class on maturity. I don't know a test that exists that is a test to measure the maturity of someone. I do premarital counseling with couples. I don't have a test to measure. Are these couples, are these individuals mature enough to get married? There's no test that can measure that. But I sure hope before they're getting married, your children are getting opportunities to persevere. When they get opportunities to persevere, and they get they get opportunities to build responsibility, they get opportunities to build patience, then they grow into maturity. Listen to James 1. He says, considerate pure joy, my brothers. Whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete. In other words, fathers, it's okay when your children face adversity because you know that it develops perseverance and it leads to maturity. Paul's called it character. In the letter to the Romans, he says this, Romans 5. We rejoice in our suffering because we know suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character hope. We want our children to understand and build character. So practically, how do we build and foster character and maturity in our kids, especially in Loudoun County? I mean, think about it. We may need to intentionally induce some suffering with our kids in Loudoun County. We may have to say no to them. We may have to make them wait. We may have to say no, even if we can afford it. We don't want our kids to have everything that they want. We may have to intentionally induce some suffering. Make them wait, put the marriage and family first. Maybe even once in a while give the kids some chores so they can contribute to the family. Fathers don't fix everything for your kids. Their toy breaks, the first thing you want to do is fix it, to stop the crying. Sometimes just let them sit with the disappointment. The toy breaks, it's sad. Because life isn't fair, and this is you're you're in the world that hasn't been fair since the Garden of Eden. Because really what you want is you don't want their first disappointment. You don't want their first suffering, you don't want their first act of perseverance to be with their first job or their first marriage. You want it to happen under your roof. They can't practice and learn how to handle disappointment if you shield them from it all the time. Suffering produces perseverance. Perseverance is the ability to handle stress and disappointment without giving up. That's what we want for our kids. As we close, I want to emphasize how much we need God's help and the help of the Holy Spirit to be a good father. So interesting as I studied about what it looks like to be a father through scripture. Same thing about what the Holy Spirit's role for us. The role of a good father, very similar to the role of the Holy Spirit. When you read in Scripture, and it's interesting, most people when they think about the Holy Spirit, they think about the role of the Holy Spirit is the one to convict, convict me when I've sinned to punish me, to make me feel guilty or shame. And they think of the role of the Holy Spirit as the convictor. The Bible talks about the role of the Holy Spirit as someone who leads us, someone who guides us, someone who assists us in our weaknesses, someone who reminds us when we forget, someone who prays for us when we don't even know what to pray for, or the Holy Spirit to come alongside, and that's what children need with the Father. Someone to guide them and lead them, remind them, assist them. Because God knows we need help. We need the help of the Holy Spirit. God's familiar with rebellious children. Think of Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve had everything that they could ever want in the Garden of Eden, and yet they broke the only command that God gave them. God kept the instruction simple. He didn't exasperate them with a bunch of rules. Here are all the fruit trees you can eat from, and here's the one that you can't, because if you do, you'll die. Simple instruction. And then the crafty serpent tempted them, they ate of the fruit, and then they were confronted by God. And what did they do when they were confronted by God? It's similar to what we do. They hid from God. They blame someone else for their sin. They tried to hide and cover it up, and then when they were caught, they tried to avoid responsibility. That's human nature. And I think it's important to notice what God doesn't do when his children, when he does when they disobeyed his clear instruction. He didn't lecture them, he didn't threaten them. He had the authority. Throw it in their face. Dads, imagine getting pulled over by a police officer for speeding. You get pulled over by that police officer and he jumps out of his car and he starts ranting and raving, screaming at you for speeding. How dare you speed so fast? You realize how much of a danger you could be and the risk you are to the other drivers, and you're gonna get a fine, and he's screaming at you. As he's lecturing and screaming and yelling at you, does your respect for him go up or down in that moment? Versus the officer that simply gets out, he has the authority, hands you a ticket or a warning, and just simply says, if you continue to do this, the warnings and the tickets and the fines will go up. See, Dads, we have the authority. How do we use it? Thankfully, God didn't yell at them. Are you kidding me? You had one rule. Let's try this again. You must have been tired. Or you must have been hungry. Can I explain one more time? Don't eat of this tree. God just gave simple instruction and then he brought a consequence. That's how he disciplined his kids. And that's what makes discipline so challenging. It requires love and consistency. It requires follow through. Requires our time and our energy. Children aren't just behavioral or moral agents that do what you want when you want them. They have a soul, they have a will, they have a heart, they have a mind. They need protection, they need provision, they need teaching and leadership, and they need your coaching, your discipline. And as fathers, we need to continue to pray for this because it is so difficult. See, as fathers, we need God's wisdom and encouragement. We need his patience, we need his courage, we need his love to lead the children that he's entrusted to us. Because God has entrusted you with the children that you have. If you have children, God has entrusted those children to you and has promised to give you everything you need to raise them. Sometimes we just need to ask for his help. God has promised to help us bring that child up to maturity. And so we're going to do this as we close. I'm going to ask all the fathers in the room to go ahead and stand. If you're a father in the room, go ahead and stand. And I'll ask this too. If you're in the chapel, if you're in the cafe, if you're watching online and want to stand, I'm going to pray for you. Because I want to be an encouragement. I want today to be an encouragement on Father's Day. Some of you are here and you have regrets and you've made mistakes. Some of you are here, you have prodigal sons or daughters, and you're praying for them, and it breaks your heart. Some of you here today didn't get much sleep last night because you got young kids and you're making sacrifices and you need encouragement. And so we're going to do this. We're just going to pray. God's entrusted us with children in our lives for a season, and we're accountable for that season for how we handle that mission. God, we thank you for the mission that you've given us. And we recognize we need your patience and your encouragement. God, we need reminders from like today that you love our children even more than we do. And you're familiar with rebellious children. And so, God, we need your help. God, I pray your blessing on each and every father that's standing here today. I pray you would encourage them, that you would fill them up with love for their kids, that you would give them the patience that they need, that you would give them the wisdom to understand the difference and the balance that they need to discipline their kids, and that they would ask for it every day. Give them courage to follow through. Help them protect and provide and teach and lead. God, none of us are experts, but we want to love and discipline our kids to the best of our ability. And to do so, we need your help. We pray for your help and the help of the Holy Spirit to do the job that you've called us to do. We love you and thank you for being the perfect Heavenly Father. We trust that you'll give us what we need when we need it. Thank you for allowing suffering in our lives that pushes us to you, that brings us to our knees. Thank you for building character and maturity in us. And I pray that we could pass that along to our kids. You blessed us so we can be a blessing. And I pray that for every father that's standing today, that you would bless them and encourage them today in Jesus' name. Amen.",
