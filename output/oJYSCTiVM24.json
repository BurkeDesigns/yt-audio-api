We call that providential. And that's what God is often up to in our lives. We just can't see it. God is working just as much openly as he does behind the scenes. Trust him. Trust him. Well, 2 Kings chapter 23 is where we are tonight. We left off about in the middle of the chapter. The part we ended with was the death of Josiah. Josiah was the real good king among all the kings. He was really the best of the kings. He dies young. He dies at the age of 39. And he was very well known for his own personal conviction of his life before the Lord. So when he's 16, he pursues the Lord with a passion. When he's 20, uh, he's this young king on the throne who brings great reform to the nation of Israel, the southern kingdom of Judah. And um and and so one of the things we pointed out last week was that it's important for us in following the example of Josiah, that it's not enough to simply put sinful things aside. They must be completely removed so that they can't come back. And one of the things that Josiah was known for was taking all of the idols and all the things that were uh representing representing evil in the country, and he destroyed them, and he didn't just remove them, he ground them to powder, it says over and over again, so that they didn't have the chance to come back. Now, kings after him, because there's still a few more here before the Babylonians come, they will return to evil. But but for for the duration of Josiah's reign, he brought true reform to the nation of Judah, and he was well known for being really a very good king, really the best of the kings. But he dies at the age of 39 because he ends up engaging in a battle that it appears that God did not call him to fight. And what happens is that there's this king of Egypt, one of the pharaohs whose name was Pharaoh Neco, and he decides to go through Judah on his way up to uh Syria to help uh the Assyrians fight uh in battle. And uh on the journey from Egypt to Assyria, the Pharaoh of Egypt, Neco, is uh is engaged in battle by Josiah. And it is during that battle there at Megiddo, where Pharaoh Neco ends up killing Josiah in battle. And so that's where we left off. Josiah dies at the age of 39, he takes an arrow and he he dies. Uh, but one of the things that spoke to me in in that the end of his life there, by the way that he engages in this battle, that it doesn't seem that God told him to fight, is uh another principle here from chapter 23, which is don't get involved in battles that aren't yours. And sometimes we have the tendency of of getting into these interpersonal battles that we have no business fighting. Like, like just stay out. It will go better for us if we don't get involved in battles that God doesn't call us to fight. And this ends up being the demise of Josiah. So a very good king, uh, brought a lot of great reform to Judah, dies young because he engaged in a battle that God didn't call him to fight. Well, and verse 30, it tells us, and then this is 2 Kings chapter 23, verse 30. It says, and then as his servants moved his body in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb, and the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father's place. And it says, and Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And it's gonna tell us why such a short reign. His mother's name was Hamathal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libna. Now, this is not the same Jeremiah, the prophet Jeremiah. This is a different Jeremiah. And verse 12 says, and he, that's Jehoahaz, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. Now, notice, not his father Josiah. This is these are his the predecessors of his heritage before Josiah. So he he engages in evil. You know, his yeah, he had a great dad, he had a great example of a father, but you know, it just goes to show you that you can be a great parent, do the best you can, and your kids might still go off the rails, and this kid goes off the rails. He's not a kid now, he's 23 years old, but he does evil in the sight of the Lord, despite the fact that his dad set a great example for him. So he does evil in the sight of the Lord according to all that his fathers had done. Verse verse 33 says, and now Pharaoh Neco put him in prison. By the way, Pharaoh Neco came out with some great wafer candies. I don't know if he's ever necos. If you if you don't know what I'm talking about, you haven't lived till you've had Neko candies. Anyway, Pharaoh Neco put him in prison, put put Jehoahaz in prison at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Now, the land of Hamath is Syria, so he puts him in prison in Ribla, takes him up, it's about Ribla's about 65 miles north of Damascus. So he puts him in prison there that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on the land a tribute of 100 talents of silver. Okay, let me translate that for you. That's 3.75 tons of silver. Okay, so that's the tribute, that's the taxation that now Neko is imposing on Judah, takes King Jehoahaz, makes him a prisoner, and then he then he assigns taxation, tribute, 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold, that's 75 pounds. And then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim, the son of Josiah, king, in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim, and Pharaoh took Jehoahaz and went to Egypt, and he died there. Now, uh Josiah has another son here besides Jehoahaz, he has another son, and the son's name is Eliakim. But because Pharaoh Necho is now powerful, and he has subdued Judah, he removes Jehoahaz as king, puts Jehoahaz's brother, Eliakim as king, and then changes his name. Now, you know, the weird thing is Eliakim in Hebrew translates uh God has uh God raises up. In other words, you know, he it's it's a charitable name about how God has raised up this guy to be king. Well, that's how he was named, but but Pharaoh Neco comes along and says, No, I'm gonna I'm gonna rename you Jehoiakim, which just took the L part of Elichim, and the L part is is the broad name for God, Elohim, and he puts in Yahweh's name, Yahwachim. I mean, it still is translating the same thing. Instead of saying that God raises up, now it's it's Yahweh raises up. Okay, why did he change his name? Because he can. That's the answer. It's like Pharaoh's now the most powerful guy in the world, and so he changes the guy's name to show that this guy is now subjugated to his power and his authority. So he imposes taxation, he he deposes Jehoahaz as king, he puts Eliakim as king, he changes Aliakim's name, and this is the condition now of the country. And it says, and so Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he he taxed the land to give money according to the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land from everyone according to his assessment to give it to Pharaoh Neco. Okay, this isn't anything new, friends, like the government's coming after you to make you pony up for whatever the bill is. And Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zabuddha, the daughter of Padiah of Rumah, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord according to all that his fathers had done. Chapter 24. In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon came up. All right, now, for you know takers, this is the first mention of Nebuchadnezzar now in the Bible. And he is the king of Babylon. So the Babylonian Empire is now the rising empire on the world scene. So we we are now seeing the waning years of the Assyrian Empire. The Egyptians have taken hold of uh Judah for just a short period of time, but the Babylonians are the ones now to reckon with. And Nebuchadnezzar, uh, this year now is around 605, 606 BC. He comes up, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. So, in other words, Nebuchadnezzar is now the one in power. And so he uh subdues Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and he makes him his vassal. Like you're gonna work for me, you're gonna pay taxes, be a good boy, don't get out of line, and it'll be okay for you, but but don't don't test me. It says, and then he returned and rebelled against him, and the Lord sent against him. Now, this is sending against Jehoiakim, raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moses. Moabites and bands of the people of Ammon, and he sent them against Judah to destroy it according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by his servants, the prophets. Now notice this, everybody, this is the Lord's doing. He is going to use these various enemy nations to subdue Judah, because this is God's judgment against Judah for their idolatry against the Lord. And they have had multiple chances because the prophets of God have continued to warn them, and yet they still continue to walk in idolatry and do evil in the eyes of the Lord. And God has been patient now for hundreds of years. But you're going to see here that just as the northern kingdom of Israel fell to Assyria in 723 BC, the southern kingdom of Judah is about to fall to the Babylonians, and the ultimate year is going to be 586 BC. So this is the beginning of the siege against Jerusalem. It's going to take 20 years. The Babylonians come in 606 BC. They won't finally subdue Jerusalem until 586 BC. So in those 20 years, I'm convinced that they still could have turned, repented, and humbled themselves before God. And God would not have used the Babylonians, but he's using them as the rod of his discipline to correct the people that he loves. And no discipline seems pleasant at the time, Hebrews tells us. But it produces a harvest of righteousness for those who have been trained by it. And sometimes when we walk in disobedience to the Lord, despite the fact that he often tries to reach us, to correct us, to to admonish us, when we walk in rebellion against the Lord, there are things that happen in order to discipline us. It's not because our father doesn't love us, quite to the contrary, it's because our father does love us. Any good parent who loves his or her children will discipline them because you don't want them to continue in their wayward ways. And the same is true for us. And the same is modeled here with the Jewish people, that God is going to use the Babylonians to discipline his people and to purge them of idolatry. And he will discipline us too, because he loves us. Okay, this is a previous king, an evil king, according to all that he had done, and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the Lord would not pardon. Now remember, Manasseh, probably the most evil of the kings. Remember one of the things that he did was he offered his own sons in the sacrifice to Kemosh and Molech. He he not only practiced child sacrifice, he promoted it in the kingdom. And they were sacrificing their children to Kemosh and Molech, because that's what the neighboring pagan nations were doing. And so God took note of the fact that he was shedding innocent blood. He was spilling innocent blood across the whole country. You know, when you go to Israel today, the valley of Ben Hinoom, the place where they would sacrifice children, is still called today, the valley of the children, to remember that they would never forget how children were sacrificed there in the shadow of the temple itself. Now it's interesting that there were other evil kings in in Israel and Judah besides Manasseh, but God calls out Manasseh in particular. You know what Manasseh's name in Hebrew means? It means he forgets. His name means he forgets. I think it's symbolic of the greater sin of the nation, because the nation forgot God. The nation forgot God. So I think it's a play on words, but it's also indicative of Manasseh's evil himself. But in the larger sense, it's like Manasseh's a picture of the whole nation. They forgot God. And they engaged in idolatrous practices and they shed innocent blood. Look, we need the mercy of God. Our own nation has shed innocent blood. 65.4 million babies have been aborted since 1973, Roe v. Wade decision. 65.4 million babies. And listen, don't you believe the left, their argument is, well, you know, ever since the Dobbs decision, now women don't have access to abortions. Do you know that in 2023, the last year where statistics were were kept until they haven't come out yet for 24 and not yet for 25. In 2023, more than a million babies were aborted in America, and that is more than any year in the last decade. We still have a great sin on our hands. We still have a great problem to correct. And we need the mercy of God because our nation is also shed innocent blood. And so it says in verse 5, now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And so Jehoiakim rested with his fathers, he died, and then Jehoah Chin, okay, this is now his sons, so don't get the names confused. Jehoa Kim, Jehoachin, his son reigned in his place, and the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon, you see, had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates. Now, the brook of Egypt is not the Nile, it's just one of the Wadis, one of the uh rivers there, the tributaries of the Nile, but but this is a vast area now. So you're talking from around the area of the Nile all the way to the Euphrates, which is in Iraq. So you're you're talking like hundreds of thousands of square miles. The Babylonian Empire now is the dominant world power. And it says, keep reading with me, in verse 8, Jehoah Chin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother's name was Nabusha, the daughter of El Nathan of Jerusalem, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. And that time, at that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. All right, so now this is around this is the second deportation. So you have the first deportation that's already occurred around 606 BC, in the first deportation, uh, among those that Nebuchadnezzar took from Judah to Babylon were Daniel and his friends, Hananiah, Azariah and Meshael. They'll be renamed when they get to Babylon. They're gonna be given Babylonian names. But those guys are teenagers. Daniel, Hanani, Azariah, Meshiah, when they get to Babylon, these are teenagers. They're thought to be 16, maybe 17 years of age. And they're gonna get taken captive as a part of those thousands who were taken captive in the first deportation of 606 BC, and they're gonna be in Babylon. Now keep that in mind, because I think this is part of obviously God's providential hand. But now we're here at the second deportation, and the years around 597 BC. The ones who go over in the second deportation among the thousands is the prophet Ezekiel. And Ezekiel will be taken from Judah, and he will end up in Babylon as well. Now keep that in mind, because I think that also plays into the providential hand of God. We'll talk about it in a minute. And so at that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem. This is verse 10, and the city was besieged, and Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came against the city as his servants were besieging it. And then Jehoiachin, king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officers, went out to the king of Babylon, and the king of Babylon in the eighth year of his reign took him prisoner. Okay, so now the king of Judah, Jehoiacin, has been taken as prisoner. We're gonna find out here a little bit later. And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king's house. Now, this is Nebuchadnezzar here. And he cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, as the Lord had said, and also he carried in captivity all Jerusalem, all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths, none remained except the poorest people of the land. Okay, so when when Nebuchadnezzar finally breaches the wall of the city of Jerusalem, he comes into the city of Jerusalem. Now the year's 586 BC. So there's these three different times when he uh besieges Jerusalem, but he finally is successful in 586. You got 606 BC, 597 BC, 586 BC. He finally penetrates the wall. He besieges the city of Jerusalem. He ransacks the temple of God, the temple that Solomon had built, and he takes the articles within the temple, and he cuts them up, and he removes them, and he confiscates the treasures in the king's house, and he takes captive, look, 10,000 people, that's not all, but among them are captains, mighty men, military commanders. Um he even takes the craftsmen and the and the blacksmiths, he's he's gonna take even skilled people and artisans, because he is going to remove from the land all the leaders, all the commanders, and all the people who are skilled workers, and the only ones that he leaves in the land, it says there are the poorest people. People. He just leaves the poorest people. Because he, you know, he thinks to himself, Well, they're not going to be any threat. So I'm going to take all the skilled people, all the leaders, all the military commanders, I'm going to take them captive. I'm either going to kill them or take them back to Babylon. I'm going to purge the land. And the only ones I'm going to leave are the poorest people. But God has not forgotten them. I just want you to know. Because among those who will stay in the land, at least for the time, is the prophet Jeremiah. You have various prophets who are at work during this time. And the prophet Jeremiah is going to be kept there in Jerusalem. And so keep that in mind too. It has to do with the providential hand of God. But keep reading with me. Verse 15. And he carried Jehoichin captive to Babylon. The king's mother, the king's wives, his officers, and the mighty of the land, he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. All the valiant men, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all who were sitting, uh rather all who were strong and fit for war, these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. And then the king of Babylon made Mataniah, Matani in Hebrew means gift of Yahweh. This is another son of Josiah. The king of Babylon made Mataniah, Jehoachin's uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. Okay, so Mataniah means gift of Yahweh, Zedekia means Yahweh is righteous. And Zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamatal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libna. And he also did evil in the sight of the Lord according to all the I mean, don't you get tired of reading that phrase? He did evil. Do you think to yourself, like, when are they gonna wake up? Like, when are they gonna wake up? Well, but they're not too unlike us, right? Like how many times do we think we're getting away with evil when in reality God sees it? And so he did evil in the sight of the Lord according to all that Jehoiakim had done. For because of the anger of the Lord, this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, that he finally cast them out from his presence, and then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. Well, that's not gonna be good. Um, but here's the deal, everybody. Um, I I want to summarize chapter 24 by pointing out the providential hand of God. I want you to notice this. What we don't see here, but what we understand when we read all of what the Bible tells us is that God puts Daniel in the palace in Babylon to influence kings. He puts Ezekiel among the Jews in Babylon to influence them, and then back home, God keeps Jeremiah in Jerusalem to influence the remnant left. So, in other words, that even though this is a dark time in Judah's history, because of their sin and rebellion, God is punishing them, he is disciplining them. He has not forgotten them, and he still has a plan for them, and he's gonna bring them through this after he accomplishes his purposes, but he is arranging these pieces behind the scenes that they're not really aware of, but because we have the 30,000 foot view, we can see from the Bible, oh, Daniel's gonna end up in the palace, and God's gonna use Daniel to influence these pagan kings. Oh, and he takes the prophet Ezekiel captive also, he allows the Babylonians to take him captive, so that he ends up in Babylon so that he can preach to the people and remind the Jews about the goodness of God despite their conditions, and then he's gonna put Jeremiah among the remnant left in Judah, because he's not forgetting the poorest among the people who were left there, and God is working in all these different ways. And it just reminded me, here's a takeaway from chapter 24, that God is providentially working in ways we cannot see. Trust him, trust him. We don't see all the pieces that God is doing behind the scenes. You don't know what God is up to in your life, but you're looking at the surface of things, because that's all we can see, and we sometimes get discouraged, and we think, oh, Lord, you know, what are you doing? And this is happening, and that is happening. You know, the Jewish people, some of the Psalms were written about how they hung their harps on the willow trees in Babylon. They had no more song left in them because they were discouraged, they were despondent, they felt terrible now about their conditions. Well, they got there because of their own sin and rebellion. Sometimes our conditions are brought about because of our sin and rebellion against God, and sometimes not. Sometimes our conditions are just because we live in a sinful fallen world. We didn't do anything to contribute to our our situation, but nevertheless, we're in a bad place, and we cry out to God, and we think that he doesn't hear us and that he's not aware of what we're going through, and all along, what he's doing is stuff we can't see behind the scenes. You see, when God moves in miraculous ways, we call those things miracles, because we see them, but God is working also in miraculous ways behind the scenes, we call that providential. And that's what God is often up to in our lives. We just can't see it. So we're always looking for the miracle because we think that's the only evidence that God is at work. My friends, listen, God is at work in unseen ways, and that's just as miraculous. We just can't see it. That's the providential hand of God. The visible hand of God are miracles. The invisible hand of God is providence. And God is working just as much openly as he does behind the scenes. Trust him. Trust him. Chapter 25. Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, so now we're 588 BC. Um, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it, and they built a siege wall. So this is giving you the backdrop to how he took the city. They built a siege wall against it all around. And so the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. Okay, so you're a smart crowd, you can do the math. So the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, the siege ramp starts, the eleventh year. So it took two years to finally penetrate uh the wall of Jerusalem. Um, but this is this is common warfare back in the day. It was it was siege warfare. In a walled city, the people would hunker down when an enemy came against the city, and you it was a waiting game. It was like a cat and mouse game. The people who came on the outside to attack the city was hoping that they could uh withstand the uh the duration of the the battle, uh and it was a uh basically the battle was a wait game, and they were hoping that the people within the city would eventually surrender because they ran out of food or water. And the people within the city were hoping that the attacking army would eventually go away because they ran out of food and water. And so it was just a waiting game. And the Babylonians outweighted the people of Judah, because the Bible will tell us, and the prophets will tell us that the people within the walled city of Jerusalem. Are you ready for this? Many of you know this because you know your Bibles, but because they ran out of food and water, they resorted to cannibalism. They started eating their children in order to try to withstand the siege of the Babylonians. It this was dark days in in in this in the nation. And so it says in verse 3 by the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. And then the city wall was broken through. And so it's July 16th, 586 BC. That's what history tells us. The city wall was broken through, and all the men of the of war fled at night by way of the gate between two walls, which was by the king's garden, even though the Chaldeans were still encamped all around against the city, and the king went by way of the plain. This is Zedekiah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. And so they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment on him. Now notice this, and then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and then put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and took him to Babylon. Talk about cruel and unusual punishment. They they take the take the last king of Judah, Zedekiah, they kill his sons in front of him, they make him watch, and then they gouge out or burn out his eyes, so that the murder of his sons was the last thing that he ever sees. I mean, this is this is just ruthless barbarism here. They take him to Babylon, and in the fifth month of the seventh day, is verse eight, in the fifth month of the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar, the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon. I'm sorry, Nebuzzaredon, sorry, that's the name of the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. He burned the house of the Lord and the king's house, all the houses of Jerusalem, that is all the houses of the great, he burned with fire, and all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around. And then Nebuzzaredan, the captain of the guard, carried away captive the rest of the people who remained in the city, and the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude. But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vine dressers and fellows. Farmers. And it says, and the bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the carts and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried their bronze to Babylon. Now I want you to notice, as they besieged the temple, okay, this is the sacred house of God. All right, they besieged the temple. They're gonna ransack it, they're gonna they're gonna take some of the bronze and the gold, and they just want the mineral rites. Um, but they're also gonna take the articles you're gonna see here in a minute. They're gonna take the sacred articles within the temple, and they're gonna take those and confiscate them as well. It says in verse 14, they also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered, the firepans and the basins, the things of solid gold and solid silver, the captain of the guard took away the two pillars, one sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord. The bronze of all these articles was beyond measure. The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were of bronze. The second pillar was the same with the network. And the captain of the guard took Sariah, the chief priest, Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, five men of the king's close associates who were found in the city, the chief recruiting officer of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city. And so Nebuzzarodan, the captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the hand in the land of Hamath, and thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land. Now, this is 586 BC. And this is the end of Jewish sovereign rule over the land of Israel until May the 14th, 1948. From this moment, 586 BC until May the 14th, 1948, the Jewish people do not have sovereignty over their own land. So what God does in 1948 to revive these, the dead bones of Ezekiel, to bring back the people, the Jewish people to their own homeland to be successful in this war for their independence. I mean, it's a total God story. But God is doing something here to purge them of their idolatry. Notice, by the way, it's just a side note. When it makes the list of all the things that Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuzzaridan had confiscated from the temple of the Lord, notice there's no reference to the Ark of the Covenant. And we don't know what has happened to the Ark of the Covenant. I mean, if you watch Raiders of the Lost Ark, you know it's in a warehouse in Washington, DC, but the reality is we don't know whatever happens to the Ark of the Covenant. Um, it's it's just it's not, it's not mentioned here. Um, and so there are some you know theories, and you know, I guess everything's a conspiracy theory these days, right? But um, you know, some say that it's it's an Ethiopia. Um, others uh say that it is under the temple mount. Umbody really knows, uh, but it's not listed here, so it's interesting. Uh some say that that Jeremiah helped to confiscate it before Nebuzaridan came and ransacked the temple, and that's why some believe that it's under the temple mount. Um, but some say that they've seen it, but there's no real proof of it, so we don't know where it is. But this is now the end of Jewish sovereignty over the land until 1948. And here's how it closes out. Verse 22. It says, and then he, that's that's Nebuchadnezzar, made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left. Now, Gedalia is a good guy. He it he's a wise friend of Jeremiah. He's mentioned in the book of Jeremiah in chapter 40. Uh, so he is put in place as this this governor of the land. Uh, verse 23 says, Now, when all the captains of the armies, they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedalia governor, they came to Gedalia at Mizpah, Ishmael, the son of Nathaniah, uh, Johannon, the son of Karia, Sariah, the son of, I mean, I know I'm butchering these people's names, uh, Tamaneth, the uh Netrophite, and uh Jazaniah the son of Macathite, anyway, they and their men, okay. And and Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men and said to them, do not be afraid. Now look at what he says here. Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans, dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. There's something that Jeremiah was telling the people, because Jeremiah was still in the land, and Gedalia is echoing this, okay? And then the message is look, God is disciplining us, so yield to his discipline. If if you just surrender to the Babylonians, this sounds like, you know, the a passive mentality here, but it's not at all. It's Jeremiah understands, and Gedalia understands God is disciplining us. So, you know, you could either make it worse for yourself. Did you ever did you ever do that? Like when your parents are like, okay, it's time for spanking. And then, and you made it worse, like you're wiggling, you're saying, no, you know, and you're, I'm thinking of like our kids right now. And uh, there's one in particular, I'm not gonna mention Austin, but you know, that middle child, just like uh, you know, just like you're you're gonna make it worse. Like, like just, you know, it could this could be over quick quickly. Um, and and so Gedalia is basically saying, you know, God is disciplining us, like he's using the Babylonians. If you just, you know, surrender to his discipline, surrender the to the chat to the chastening of the Lord, it'll go well with you. But notice, but it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael, the son of Nathaniah, the son of Elishanah of the royal family, came with ten men and struck and killed Gedalia. They didn't like this. The Jews, as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah, and all the people, small and great, and the captains of the armies arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. And now it came to pass in the 37th year of the captivity of Jehoachin. Remember I told you he was in prison for 37 years. This is this is the statement. Jehoiachin, one of the one of the last kings of Judah. Thirty-seven years in prison. But notice, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that evil Morodak, okay. Now, your footnotes just translate it, man of Marduk. So it looks like a bad name, like evil. I mean, he he is, he's the next king of Babylon, he succeeds Nebuchadnezzar. So you know, he's a pagan guy, but notice what he does. He does a good thing here. Evil Morodah, king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, which is 560 BC, he released Jehoiachin, king of Judah from prison, and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon. Now notice this. And so Jehoichon changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life. And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life. This is how the whole book of 2 Kings ends. There's this king of Babylon who succeeds Nebuchadnezzar, who just decides to show favor to Jehoachin, a former king of Judah, who's been in prison for 37 years. I don't know the age of evil Morodak, but I wonder if he was even alive. He's probably a young guy, and yet he does something for this stranger, and he does a merciful thing. And that's how the whole book of 2 Kings ends. And you just kind of wonder, like, and why did he do that? Why was he motivated to do it? I tell you why I think he was motivated to do it, because God put it on his heart. And God put it on his heart to do a merciful thing for a guy who didn't deserve mercy. Because Jehoiachin was an evil king, and he did evil after his father's before him. And yet in the midst of justice, God showed his mercy. And that's how the whole book of 2 Kings ends. God shows mercy, even in his justice. And aren't you thankful for that? Right? I am. I am for myself. Amen. Amen. Well, Lord, we thank you for your word. And thank you for your mercy that even when you were doing what is just and right and holy and true, and it might be painful for us. You still display your mercy in bountiful ways. And thank you, Lord, for ending this tragic story on a merciful note. You did a favorable thing for a guy who didn't deserve it by releasing him from prison, putting it on the heart of this pagan king to release an evil man, and then invite him to the king's table, give him daily rations, and honor him. And Lord, it's a picture for us. We don't deserve your mercy, and yet you grant us a seat at the king's table. And you are merciful to us in ways that we do not deserve. And we thank you that even in your justice, you are a merciful God. And we give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus' name. And everyone said, Amen and amen.",
