Oh, just towing, and just how high is the love I found in Christ. Oh, what a love. Oh, what a love I found in him. What love I found in. I can't fully comprehend how much the father gave. It's only by his kindness I'm cute and I am saying. He lifted up my head. He lifted off my stream. Thank you, Jesus. This is all me. Sacrifice. Oh my god. Oh, I love me. And make it separate us from your life. Oh my test. Oh, what love. Oh, what am I? Amen. Thank you, worship team. They've done eight services so far. Let's give the Lord some praise for them. Thank you, everybody. Well, welcome to church. We have gathered here to celebrate the risen Lord Jesus. Give him praise in the house of the Lord. Praise his name. We uh appreciate you being here. Thank you for coming. Unfortunately, not everyone could get in the sanctuary, so we want to welcome people, and we have some cameras in the room. So first let's go to the chapel and welcome people. That's not the chapel. That's uh there you go, chapel people. Hello. Welcome, Chapel Cafe. Hello, everybody in the cafe. Wave to us, cafe people. Wave to us, cafe people. Cafe people.

They are drunk. They are completely wasted all. Hey, there you go. They're like, we've had a lot of coffee. Leave us alone. So good to have you with us. Hey, in all the previous services, we've also been recognizing people who have come to worship with us. And they have driven from out of state, far distances, and they didn't come for family or friends. They came only to worship with us. I met a people from Florida from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, um, New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and then last service, there's a lady from Hong Kong, and last night, lady from Italy. They came just to worship with us. So if you're yeah, if you are here, if you're here just to worship with us, not because you were here to visit family or friends, and you're you're out of state some distance. Raise your hand.

And oh, hands are going. From Mexico, hermano. Thank you. Good to have you here. All right, everybody. We have gathered here and we welcome our online viewers as well. It's a great day to be in the house of the Lord to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ to join with tens of thousands of other people around the world for this glorious occasion. It is the most important holy day. It really is a holy day where we just are worshipful and thankful for the gift of Jesus Christ. I'm gonna start out with a cute story. I actually heard Chuck Swindal share this story. It's a true story written. This little note was written by an eighty-three-year-old man. He said, quote, I know I shouldn't have done this, but I am eighty-three years old. I was going through the drive-thru at McDonald's. The young lady behind me must have thought that I was taking too long to place my order because she started laying on her horn and yelling profanities out the window at me. When I got to the first window, I paid for her order along with my own. Well, the cashier must have told her what I had done because as we moved up, she leaned out her window waving and saying, thank you, thank you. Probably feeling embarrassed that I had replaced or repaid rather her rudeness with kindness. When I got to the second window, I showed the server both receipts, and I took her food too. Now she has to go back to the end of the queue and start all over again. Don't blow your horn at old people. We've been around for a long time. Oh my goodness. That young lady was outwitted by an old Older, wiser man. In a similar way on Easter Sunday, Satan, sin, and death were outwitted by a wiser, sovereign God of the universe. Amen. God gave his son Jesus Christ to die for the sins of the world. And Jesus Christ, miraculously, majestically, victoriously, powerfully, physically rose from the dead. And we have gathered here to worship him. He is Lord of all. Buddha is still in the grave. Confucius is still in the grave. Joseph Smith is still in the grave. Only Jesus Christ is alive forever and ever. And after those 40 days, he then ascended back into heaven, where he is presently seated at the right hand of the Father, and the Bible says that he is coming again. This was all the divine plan of God. The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ was all orchestrated and designed by a loving Father in heaven who wants to redeem a broken world. We are broken. I am a broken man. You are broken people. The whole world is broken. But the good news is that while the world generally discards things that are broken, the God of the universe goes after broken things to make broken people whole, to make broken people whole. And so I'm excited to see what God is going to do today in this service. There's no hidden agenda here, friends. No up front. This service is about celebration and salvation. This is about celebrating the risen Lord Jesus who rose from the dead, and this is about offering salvation to all who would believe in him by faith for the forgiveness of their sins and for the promise and assurance of heaven when they die. I'm passionate about seeing people come to know the Lord in a personal way. We don't offer you religion here. You will not find religion. Religion is a man-made system of rules and regulations. What the Bible teaches is a relationship that one can have with the creator of the universe through his son Jesus Christ. And at the end of the service, full disclosure, I'm gonna give anyone the opportunity who wants to receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior. I'll give an invitation for you to be able to come forward and say, Yes, I want to pray to receive Christ as my Savior. So just know it up front. I I'm I'm not hiding anything. This is important to us because God loves you and he wants a relationship with you. The Bible says, For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus is what makes him unique among anyone who ever walked the earth, and it's what makes Christianity unique among all other world religions. And so God is here today at work. And I'm gonna share the story with you, and this story is true, and the history of it was recorded by secular and sacred ancient writings. Some of you might be surprised to learn that outside of the Bible, there are additional secular historical resources that have documented the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I'm gonna share just one with you. This is written as an historic as an historical record from a guy by the name of Titus Flavius Josephus. Josephus was born five years after Christ was crucified and rose from the dead. So he lived at a time when he grew up where he could still interview people who were personal eyewitnesses of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Josephus was hired by the Roman government in the first century to give an historical record of the times. Josephus was Jewish, but he never claimed to be a follower of Jesus Christ. So he writes what he does from the standpoint of secular historical facts, facts and a record, not as some convert to Christianity. And this is what Josephus wrote. I'll read just a couple of sentences from the first century. Quote About this time came Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it is appropriate to call him a man, for he was a performer of paradoxical feats, meaning miracles, a teacher of people, and he won over many of the Jews and also many Greeks. Now listen to that. Christ is another word for Messiah. Josephus, first century saying, Jesus was the Messiah. When Pilate, upon the accusation of the first man amongst us, condemned him to be crucified. Those who had formerly loved him did not cease to follow him, for he appeared to them on the third day, living again as the divine prophets foretold. End quote. An eyewitness account by John. John wrote one of the gospels that bears his name. He was there for the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. I'm gonna read from John 19 and 20. I'm gonna skip a few verses to sew the whole story together, but here we go. This is John 19, starting at verse 1. And so then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe. And then they said, Hail, King of the Jews, and they struck him with their hands. Pilate then went out again and said to them, Behold, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him. And then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man. Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Verse 16. And then he delivered him to them to be crucified. And then they took Jesus and led him away. And he bearing his cross went out to a place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha, where they crucified him and two others with him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. Verse 38. After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. And so he came and took the body of Jesus. And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. And then they took the body of Jesus and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden, a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. And so there they laid Jesus because of the Jews' preparation day for the tomb was nearby. Chapter 20. Now the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. And then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved. The other disciple is John. He's writing in the third person here. Jesus loved me. Okay, we get it. And Mary said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him. Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb. And so they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter. Okay, he's a better athlete too. And came to the tomb first, and he, John, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there, and yet he did not go in. And then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb, and he saw the linen cloths lying there, and the handkerchief that had been around his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together in a place by itself. And then the other disciple who came to the tomb first went in also, and he saw and believed. For as yet they did not know the scripture that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again to their own homes. But Mary stood outside by the tomb, weeping, and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb. And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And then they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? And she said to them, because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him. Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. The title of my message is A Tale of Two Gardens, a Tale of Two Gardens. Let's pray together. Father in heaven, it is good to be in your house, and we celebrate Jesus in this place. And you tell us in your word, Lord, that if you are lifted up, you will draw all men, all people to yourself. And so we lift you up, Jesus, and we pray right now you would draw men and women and young people to you, so that at the end of this service, many will leave here forgiven and changed because of what you've done to meet us here in a personal relationship. So be glorified, Lord. We thank you, and we celebrate with tens of thousands of others. There's around the world today, the glorious resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In his name we pray, and everyone said, Amen. In the Bible, there are a few different gardens that are mentioned specifically. The very first garden that is mentioned in the Bible, in fact, the first time the word garden appears in the Bible is Genesis chapter 2. And Genesis chapter 2 describes a garden that probably almost everyone is familiar with. I would, I would guess that if you even go on the street and just ask a random person, have you ever heard of this garden? People who don't even attend church or read their Bibles will have heard of it at least. And so Genesis chapter 2 introduces us in the Bible to the very first garden mentioned. It is the Garden of Eden, the Garden of Eden. Now the Bible doesn't give us a whole lot of description about the Garden of Eden, but this much it does tell us. In Genesis 2 9, it says, God planted it. God created, God designed, God planted the Garden of Eden. And the Bible also says that it was lush with beautiful vegetation. In fact, it had many trees, and Genesis 2 9 said that the trees were, quote, pleasant to the sight and good for food. Two of the trees were named. One was the tree of life, one was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And the Bible also says that there was a river that meandered through the Garden of Eden, and then it diverged into four rivers. Now, two of the rivers we're familiar with today, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Now, since the Garden of Eden, we've had the worldwide flood. So we don't know if the Tigris and Euphrates today are in the same location as the Tigris and Euphrates of the Garden of Eden. But if they are, that would place the Garden of Eden in the location of Iraq. The Bible says that God then formed man out of the dust of the earth, gave him a name, Adam in Hebrew. It just means red or ruddy like the clay. Adam was his name. And Adam was placed in the garden to care for it and to enjoy it. There was only one stipulation. It's in Genesis chapter 2, verses 16 and 17. This is what God said to Adam. Of every tree of the garden, you may freely eat. Now hear that freedom that God gave to him. Of every tree in the garden you may freely eat. But, here's the exception. Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die. Literally, it means the dying process will begin. Why is it that God gave this one stipulation about this one tree? The answer is because one of the things that God has given us as a gift is the ability to choose him. And the reason why God offered choice in the garden, you can choose to obey me or disobey me, is because God wants a relationship with humanity based on love, not law. He didn't create humanity like robots and wind us up and say, now love me, serve me, worship me. He gave man the choice. Do you want to love me? Do you want to obey me? Or do you want to disobey me? Do you want to reject me? He wants a relationship with us based on love. And so that tree was given there as a choice, so that Adam could choose to obey God and to love God. The Bible then says that God put Adam into a deep sleep, extracted some DNA from his side, and fashioned woman. Her name was Eve. And the two of them lived in the garden, and it was perfect. Perfect. They had no jobs. They had no bills to pay. There were no crazy aunts or uncles in their families. He didn't have mommy issues. She didn't have daddy issues. It was just the two of them enjoying life. It was perfect. It was almost paradise knocking at heaven's door. If you know that song, you know where I just went in my head. It was beautiful. Perfect. Until Satan comes slithering into that garden. Now Satan was a fallen angel. He had already rebelled against God, and he had led a rebellion of many angels in heaven. And they were expelled from heaven and kicked to earth. Satan had already sinned, already fallen. And now he's going to go after God's prized possession, humanity. And why? Because humanity was the jewel in God's crown of creation. Every day that God created the universe, the first five days, at the end of the day, God said, It was good. It was good. He said that five times. But on the sixth day, when he created man, when he was done, he looked at mankind and his creation and he said, It is very good. It is very good. And why? Because mankind is distinct from the plant and animal kingdom, in that mankind is the only part of God's creation that has been given ruach in Hebrew, a spirit. We've been given the very breath of God, the Spirit of God, so we can commune, connect, and have relationship with him. And Satan targeted what God loves most. And he went after humanity, and he started with Eve. Now, if you think a serpent is scary enough, consider a talking serpent. Okay? That's pretty spooky, right? Let me tell you, it wasn't spooky to them. Here's why. Adam and Eve had no standard by which to judge normal. It was the age of innocence. So a talking serpent wasn't like startling because they didn't know anything to be unusual. In addition, here's why they weren't frightened by Satan who came in the form of this serpent. Because in Genesis, when it says that he was a serpent, it is the Hebrew word nahash for serpent. It translates copper or bronze. See, when Satan came into the garden as a serpent, he was a beautiful bronze shade of copper shade that glistened in the sunlight, he was beautiful. And don't you know that Satan still plays that game of making things that are consequential look really shiny and beautiful. He wants you to think that that affair is shiny. He wants you to think that that money you could steal is shiny. Pride is shining. All kinds of things. He plays us a thousand ways, making us think that things are beautiful and shiny. And this is the way that he appears to Eve. This beautiful serpent glistening in the sunlight, telling her, God's holding back on you. God's denying you the best. If you were to eat of that one tree that he said, your eyes would be opened, you'd be like God. Satan was envious of humanity, so he attacked humanity. And Eve believed the lie. And she ate of the fruit, and the Bible says that she turned and gave to her husband, which means he was there too. And he was derelict in his duty because he did not intercede and say to Eve, No, honey, sweetheart, we can't eat from this tree. And that's why in the Bible, the blame is really laid at the feet of Adam. Adam was the one who not only ate, but he also shirked his responsibility. And therefore the Bible talks about the sin of Adam, and that first garden was ruined. The relationship that man had with God that was perfect and pure became distant and disgraced. And when they sinned against God, God expelled Adam and Eve from that first garden and posted angels so that they could not come back in. And here's how that first garden impacts every single one of us. Are you ready for this? Because of Adam's sin, it altered his nature. It corrupted his soul. And thus every descendant of Adam has inherited his sin nature. That's you. That's me. We've all inherited a sin nature. Through one man's sin, the human race became corrupted. Romans chapter 5, verse 12 tells us this. It says, through one man, Adam, sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned. You see, we have to understand the human condition. The Bible tells us we're all sinners. We've received a sin nature from Adam, and thus that's why we all disobey God. If anyone has an ounce of self-awareness, you will agree. We have all thought things, done things, said things that we feel ashamed about. If people only knew half the things that we thought or have done, we'd be doubly ashamed. That's the nature of humanity. Sinful, because we've inherited the sin nature, and thus we sin. David understood this. He said in Psalm 51, verse 5 surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me in the womb. He understood. We've inherited a sin nature because of Adam's sin. And so, friends, the first garden was ruined because of man's sinfulness, and it has impacted every single one of us to this day. But now here's the good news. There was another garden. That garden is mentioned in our Easter story. We might even call it, if you will, the garden of Easter. This one has to do with the place where Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose again. Did you hear it when I read the text earlier? I'll just reread two verses. Listen to me. This is John 19. Verses 41 and 42. It says, Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden. And in the garden, a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. And so they laid Jesus there because of the Jews' preparation day for the tomb was nearby. Now, perhaps if you've never been to Israel, you've thought when you have heard this story that the cross is one place and the tomb is someplace else. If you've been to Israel, you've seen this with me. We can sit in the place of the traditional garden tomb, and you can see the place of the skull where Jesus was crucified. It's no more than 30 yards away. Now the place of the skull, it's called that because there's this one place in Jerusalem outside the city where the outcropping of rocks looks just like a human skull. And so it's called the place of the skull. Hebrew it's Galgatha. In Latin, it's calwarium. We get our English word Calvary from that word. That's where Jesus was crucified. And the Bible says there was a garden where he was crucified and where he was buried, because the tomb was nearby. So all of this transpired in this same garden. Now, hear this. What man ruined in the first garden, God redeemed in the second garden. Can you give God praise for that? He redeemed us. What Christ did on the cross by dying for our sins, being laid in that tomb and rising again. God did that in another garden, separate from the first. It was a place of redemption. Hear the contrast. In the first garden, sin entered. In the second garden, sin was forgiven. In the first garden, death reigned. In the second garden, death was conquered. In the first garden, man was separated from God. In the second garden, man was reconciled to God. In the first garden, angels were posted so that they could not go back in after the fall. In the second garden, angels were posted so that they could get into the tomb to see that it was empty. And then this, in the first garden, the punishment, the judgment that God pronounced against Adam. The ultimate judgment was death. But the initial judgment was ground that was cursed with thorns. I'll read just a couple verses to you. Listen to Genesis 3. Cursed is the ground, God says to Adam, for your sake, in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life. Listen, but thorns, both thorns and thistles, it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken, for dust you are, and to dust you shall return. When God pronounces this initial judgment of thorns, it's not just saying the soil is going to be thorny. What he's communicating is, life is gonna be hard because of sin. This world will be very thorny. There will be toils and hardships. There will be heartaches. There is suffering in this world. There is sorrow, there is pain. Listen, we all experience this at some point if you live long enough, because we live in a fallen world full of sin. And some of the things that we experience in terms of sorrow and pain will simply be by virtue of the fact that we live in a fallen world. And some of the sorrow and pain we experience in our lives are because we have made sinful choices ourselves. We've invited the pain. But here's the good news. Thorns were also in the second garden. Jesus wore them. Jesus wore them. Now I'm sure when the Roman soldiers fashioned a crown of thorn, and I've had one that's a replica for years. Here it is. I'm sure when the Roman soldiers fashioned this because they were mocking Jesus, that they had no idea the symbolism when they pray when they placed this thorny crown on his head. But here's the symbolism. You see, the curse of the first garden that affects us all Jesus. He wore the curse intended for us. He took the punishment intended for me and for you. Our shame, our sin was all pressed onto Jesus, and he wore a crown of thorns because Jesus took for us our punishment and our sin. Jesus wore the crown of thorns. This is the contrast of two gardens. What man ruined in the first garden, God redeemed in the second garden. And God says, All I want you to do is to come to Jesus to receive the one who took on our pain, our suffering, our shame, and our sin, and trust him and what he did on that cross to redeem us. Do you know him as your Lord and Savior? Do you know the forgiveness that comes from Jesus? You can leave here today knowing that you were forgiven, knowing you are right with God, knowing that you're going to heaven when you die, if you trust him by faith that what he did was sufficient for you. Listen, we have to understand the human condition again. Because we have all sinned, sin must be punished. Why must it be punished? Because God is a just and a holy God. And if he allowed our sin to go unpunished, he would not be just and holy. We get this on a human level. Let's say that somebody committed a crime against you, and they are prosecuted for it. They are found guilty. And then the day they stand before the judge for sentencing, the judge winks. I don't really care what you did, you're free to go. You'd be outraged. That judge would not be just, and thus God, because he is just and holy must punish us for our sin against him. But because he loves us, you see, he provided a way so that we wouldn't have to suffer for our sins or be punished for our sins. God determined that if one person was righteous enough, pure enough and holy enough, that person could take his punishment for the sake of every other sinful person. The problem with that is that when God surveyed the landscape of humanity, he found none righteous, none of us. And so in Isaiah 63, verse 5, the Bible says that God said, My own arm worked salvation for me. God came, took on flesh, his name is Jesus, and his sinless life was given in exchange for all of our sinful lives. And God decided that the punishment intended for all of us would be placed on his son on the cross. The judgment intended for us, all our sin, all our shame. Jesus took that for you, and he took that for me. And then he says, if you just come to him and trust him, your sins will be forgiven. You'll be made right with God. On the cross, his arms are stretched out. It's very symbolic of him saying, Come to me, all you who are weary, heavy laden, I'll give you rest. I love you. My arms are open wide to you. But you have to choose him. He gave us choice in the first garden, and he still wants us to choose him today. Jesus chose you two thousand years ago when he bore our sins on that cross. Won't you come today and trust him as your Lord and Savior? You say, Well, how do I do that? Three things. It's really very simple. Please hear me. Number one, admit you're a sinner like everybody else. The Bible says in 1 John 1 8, if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Next verse. But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. You have to admit you're a sinner. Number two, you have to acknowledge you need a Savior. Too many people in this world think that they can get to heaven because they're a good, decent person. Can I just kindly say to you that good people don't get to heaven? Only forgiven people. So we have to admit we're sinners, we have to acknowledge we need a savior. And then the last thing is we have to accept Jesus as the only Savior. Jesus said in John 14, 6, I am the way, the truth, the life, no man gets to the Father but by me. He did not say, I am a way among many. He said, I am the way, the truth, the life. But anyone can come and trust him. Some of you today are gonna trust Jesus for the very first time. Others of you today, well, you've tasted and seen that the Lord is good, but you've strayed and wandered and you know it. And the Lord's been dealing with you, and it's time for you to come home to him. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna start to pray in just a minute. And when I do, I want to invite anyone who wants to pray. Pray to receive Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins and the promise of heaven when you die to be unashamed and to get up out of your seats and to come stand down here. And then for the whole group that's standing down here, I'm gonna lead in a word of prayer for you to receive Christ as your Lord and Savior. Now you say, why do I have to come out of my seat and get down there in the front in front of all these people? Well, listen, a few reasons. One, Jesus said in Matthew 10, 32, he said, if you acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge you before my Father. But if you deny me before men, I will deny you before my Father in heaven. And here's another reason why we should come publicly before Him. Because Jesus died a very public, humiliating death for you and me. Look what it cost him compared to what it costs us. I'm a little uncomfortable because I'm walking down a church aisle in front of all these people when Jesus suffered publicly and took on our shame and our guilt. People will literally applaud you when you walk down here because we're excited for those who are gonna make a decision for Christ. But you should only come if you choose him. No one should feel manipulated or coerced. This is freely offered, and this is freely received. I'm talking also to those of you in the cafe, in the chapel, in the courtyard. You should start walking now because I want to include you too. So if you want to receive Christ, come now. I'm gonna start to pray. I want to make it easy for people who want to slip out and walk down here. Can I ask everyone not to leave, not to get restless, but just to quietly stand. Would you mind all just standing so people can slip out? And even now, this is the day for you to commit your life to Christ. If you want to trust Him for the first time, or if you want to recommit your life and come home. God bless you. Come on, even now. Come on, even now, everybody. God bless you guys. God bless you guys. God bless you all. Come on. If you want to trust Christ as your Savior, know that your sins are forgiven. Make your way down here. If you're in the overflow rooms, come now. This is the day the Lord is made. We invite you to come and receive him as your Lord and Savior. Thank you, Lord, for those that you are leading to you right now. We pray for these men and women and young people that you would move mightily in their hearts as they make a decision for you. Thank you, Jesus, that you chose us two thousand years ago. We give you praise that you died for our sins and rose again. So, Lord, leave those right now who would make a decision to trust you as Lord and Savior. We're gonna sing this chorus. Mike uh Oscar's gonna lead us. Let's sing this song together. Sing it, church. Are you heard in broken with it? Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. You can keep coming. Come on down here, anybody join these folks. God bless you, sir. Come on down here. Have you come to the end of yourselves? Anybody can come. Jesus is called. Come on down here, guys. God bless you guys. God bless you guys. Come on. Come to the altar. The Father's. Arms are open wide to you. Forgiveness. Was God with the precious blood of Jesus Christ? Anyone else want to come? God bless you, ladies. Come on down here. God bless you guys. If anybody wants to come and join these folks, we're gonna sing this chorus just one more time. We don't belabor this because then somebody could feel like they're manipulated. But I tell you this, don't leave here with regret either. If the Lord is telling on your heart, this is the day to get right with him. This is the day to know your sins are forgiven. Before I lead this group in a word of prayer, come join them. Thank you. God bless you. Let's sing this chorus again. Yes. The Father's Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Forgiveness. Thank you, Jesus. The precious bless you guys. Amen. God bless you. Come on, y'all. We'll wait for you. I'm gonna ask you guys to just take like a step forward a little bit, so make room for some people. There you go. There you go. God bless you guys. We don't want to leave anybody out. Anyone else want to come? You guys coming up here? God bless you guys. Come join us. Come join us. Anybody else? Anybody else? Come now. Come on, give God some praise. Give God some praise. We rejoice with these people who have come forward. All right, everybody, I'm gonna lead you in a word of prayer, and I'm gonna go slowly enough that I want you to repeat this prayer after me. This is the most important decision you've ever made in your life. We're so excited for you. We're so grateful that you came forward. And God is so God is so blessed. Because he loves you. This is why Jesus came. All right, I see some people waving. Come on down. We'll wait for you. Come on. We'll wait for y'all. God bless you, man. Come on up here. God bless you, man. God's heart is for you. Sorry. So I'm gonna lead you in this prayer. And I just want you to pray this out loud with me. Just be loud and proud about it. Just be bold about this prayer. And then after we finish praying, don't quickly go back to your seat because are you all coming up here? Come on, we'll wait for you, ladies. Come on up here. God bless you, guys. Come on up here. Amen. Just wait long enough. Our pastors are gonna circulate through the group. I hear applause, but I see. Come on up here, bud. Come on up here, man. God bless you. God bless you. Our pastors are gonna circulate through you and give you Bibles. We don't want anything from you. This is just a gift to give you Bibles, even if you have one to remember today's decision. And then a reminder on Wednesday, we have baptisms. Baptism's not required for salvation. What you're about to pray is sufficient by faith. But baptism shows that you're saved if you want to come back Wednesday night. We're gonna have baptisms. But for now, I want you to pray this prayer with me. Loud and proud. Ready? Here we go. Say, dear Jesus. Hold on, I'm gonna hold up because some other people are coming. Come on, we don't want to. We don't want to leave you out. All right, now look, everybody. I got one more service to do. If you want to come, you better come now. Or you can come to the next service. Is there anyone else? Anyone else? Still coming? All right, come on. Come on. All right, everybody. I'm gonna lead in this word of prayer. Here we go. Say, dear Jesus. I thank you. I thank you that you love me so much. You would die on a cross for me. Forgive me of my sins. Make my life clean. Come into my heart today. I accept you, Jesus. I accept you, Jesus by faith. As my Lord and my Savior. And I surrender my life to your Lordship. In Jesus' name I pray. In Jesus' name I pray. And everybody here said, Amen and amen. Come on, church, give God some praise in the house of the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. All right, pastors. Come on, pastors. Start moving through the group here and hand out Bibles. We have children's Bibles for children, adult Bibles for you adults. As soon as you get your Bible, you're free to go back to your seat. If you prayed that prayer with us online, you can text the church and we'll send you a Bible. The phone number should be there posted online. And so we'll send you a Bible anywhere you live in the world. And we praise God for you as well. All right, friends, listen, the Bible says the angels in heaven rejoice over one sinner who repents. We have one more worship song. Let's go out praising the risen Savior. God bless you, everybody. Praise on the mountain. Praise them down. Praise men surrounding. As long as I'm praying. I have a reason to walk.
