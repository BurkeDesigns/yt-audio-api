The one the darkness can't deny the resurrection and the life Jesus. Your name can heal. Your name can make the storm be still. You never will Jesus. The bread of life broken forever. And the worthy one soon to come. Jesus be the name. It makes me cry whole. Oh, there's freedom in your name. There's freedom in your name. There's freedom in your name. Oh Jesus, your worthy.

What is done? All the glory and the honor is to the sun. My sins are forgiven. My future is heaven. I praise God for what he has done. Even death is dead, and then his life has over. Amen. You can be seated if you would, please, because we're gonna incorporate communion into our worship time as we remember the sacrifice of the Lord on the cross for our sins. So the ushers are gonna come and I'm gonna lead us in a word of prayer. If this is new to you, don't feel obligated to participate. But in a moment, the ushers are gonna pass trays down each row, and on each tray are little sealed cups of grape juice. On the bottom of the cup is sealed a piece of bread. This is a reminder of the bread, the body of Jesus, the juice, the blood of Jesus, how his body was nailed to a cross and his blood was shed for the sins of the whole world. How many of you are thankful for the salvation that comes through Jesus? So let's pray. Father, we just come before you now with humble hearts, glad and sincere. Seer hearts. Grateful for what you've done for us. We just sang about this, Lord. And we could continue to sing. There would not be enough songs to sing for all eternity in order to really express our gratitude for what you've done for us. Thank you for the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. Thank you that our sins can be washed away if we would just simply surrender to you, put our faith and trust in you and ask you to forgive us of our sins. So we remember the cross this morning. We remember your shame. We we remember your suffering. We remember how you provided for us eternal life through faith in Jesus. So Lord, as we distribute the elements, we just pray now that we would receive these with glad and sincere hearts. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. So we're gonna sing a song while the elements are being distributed. Just hold your elements until we've all been served, and then I'll come back up and we'll partake together. Let's worship the Lord. And for content for the cross. Oh who gather here? I agree strong here. And see from his hands, his love flow. Indeed, here's such love and thorns come close. So mine all free small. So I soul my life, my Jesus, thank you for your love for us displayed on that cross. We remember your words when you broke bread with your disciples at that last Passover meal. You took the bread, you broke it, you gave thanks. You said, This is my body which is broken for you. Take and eat in remembrance of me. On the bottom of your cup, you can just peel back that cover and let's take the bread and let's partake together in remembrance of the body of our Lord Jesus. And likewise, after supper, Jesus took the cup. And he said, This cup is my blood of the new covenant which is shed for you. Drink all of it in remembrance of me. Let's do likewise now. We thank you, Lord. That you laid down your life for the sins of the whole world, for my sins, for our sins. That through faith in your finished work, we might be forgiven. Thank you for our salvation. We give you praise and glory. Come, Lord. Come soon. Rescue us from this weary world. We look forward to that day. We can be with you forever and ever. Until then, Lord, find us faithful. We love you in Jesus' name. Amen and amen. The ushers are gonna pass little bags down each row so you can drop your used cups.

So you got plenty of time to pray about this and figure out if you want to go. All right. Uh, so good to see you here. It's uh great to be with you. Welcome to our online viewers as well. We're gonna be here in Philippians chapter two this morning. If you have your Bibles there now. Paul writes this letter to Christians in Philippi, Greece while he is in prison in Rome, Italy, awaiting trial before Emperor Nero because he was preaching the gospel. That's why he was arrested. Our series through to Philippians is entitled Reasons to Rejoice, because despite his circumstances, Paul uses the word joy or rejoice 14 times in this little letter of just four chapters. And so far we have seen four reasons to rejoice out of chapter one. Number one, God will finish what he has started concerning us. Number two, that God will use our chains or our difficulties for his divine purposes. Number three, to live as Christ to die is gain. Heaven is gonna be better than earth. We don't rush it, but we look forward to it. And then number four, last week, unity comes through humility and humility comes from following the example of Jesus. And we're gonna continue now in chapter two. I'm gonna start in verse 12 and read down through verse 18. Philippians 2, verse 12. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you, both to will and to do for his good pleasure. Do all things without complaining and disputing, that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life so that I may rejoice. There's that word in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain or labored in vain. Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. For, verse 18, the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me. So Paul writes here about the importance of our witness, our testimony, and how when we represent Jesus to others, that it brings great joy to the world, and no doubt it brings great joy to the heart of God. And so the reason to rejoice, number five, is when our witness impacts our world. This is right out of the heart of what I just read there. I'll read again, verse 14 to 16. Do all things without complaining and disputing, that you may become blameless and harmless children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ. Let's pause there and pray. Father in heaven, we thank you for this for this day that you've given us, Lord. With each day that you've given us breath, we rejoice. And we thank you, Lord. We just give you praise now for your word. We pray that you would use it to speak to us. Thank you, Lord, for those who are here and those who are watching online. We just want all of this to bring you praise and glory. So, Lord, be glorified now in our Bible study and use it to speak to our own hearts. We're grateful people. And we thank you in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen. Well, Paul is gonna build here on the first part of chapter two that we talked about last week, about the importance of getting along and how we develop unity through humility by following the example of Christ. He's gonna build on that as he continues here in chapter two, and he's gonna say, okay, now now that you understand the importance of having unity in the church among believers, and you're gonna gain that through humility as you follow the example of Christ. He goes, Let me tell you why that's so important. He says, Because the church needs to be a witness to a lost world. And if and if we're not unified, and if we're not humble, then how can we ever really spread the good news of Jesus? So he puts this emphasis on the importance of living out our faith in a in an evident way, in a tangible way, so that others can hear and know and receive the message of Jesus. And Paul points out what is consistently true about every culture, and this is why he's saying we we have this mandate to be his witnesses and to be a testimony of Jesus in our world, because look again in your Bibles, verse 15, right in the middle of verse 15, because we live in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. Just circle those words, crooked and perverse. Now, this was true in the first century when Paul wrote this clearly. This is true about the Roman Empire in the first century with all of its perversion and immorality. If you know anything about Roman history, pretty hedonistic. And it is certainly true for our culture today as well. I mean, what Paul wrote here is almost 2,000 years old, but it's it's timeless. We live in a very perverse generation. Pornography, sex trafficking, crimes against children, same-sex marriage, boys using girls' bathrooms, girls using boys' bathrooms, abortion. It's all perverse. The Greek word is diastrafo. It means to turn aside from the right path. We've gotten off the right path. Every culture deals with this. Ours is no different. The Bible says in Isaiah 53, verse 6, all we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned every one to his own way. In other words, we've we've gotten off the path, and we've just started doing our own thing. Every culture is described as perverse, every culture's described as crooked. That's the other word that he uses there in verse 15. It's the Greek word in the original language, scholios. We get our English word scoliosis from this. It's the curvature of a spine. If you have scoliosis, when your back is bent, that accurately describes every culture in human history. The world is crooked. The culture is bent. It has its own version of morality and truth. It has its own version of right and wrong. And that happens when a culture forgets God. And when it denies the objective standard of God and is not aligned with the straight truth of God's word. You know, back in the Old Testament in the book of Amos, Amos was one of the prophets of old. And Amos had this encounter with the Lord, and he writes about it in Amos chapter 7, verses 7 and 8. I'll read it to you. You don't need to turn. This is what Amos wrote in Amos 7, verse 7. Thus he, the Lord showed me. Behold, the Lord stood on a wall made with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. And the Lord said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, a plumb line. And then the Lord said, Behold, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people. Now, most of us, I'm sure are acquainted with the plumb line. It's what builders and masons use to determine if they are building a wall vertically straight. Today they might use a laser, but a plumb line is a it's a string with a plummet weight on the end of the string so that when you hold the string, the weight dangles straight down so that you can align something vertically with the plumb line to make sure that the wall that you're building or constructing is true vertically. The plumb line is the standard by which everything else is measured. You get that one line wrong, the rest of the building is gonna be crooked. It has to be established straight according to the plumb line. And against the plumb line, one would be able to determine then what was true. In other words, what was vertically straight. And in this passage, Here in Amos 7, God was saying to us that He is the plumb line. He is the objective moral standard by which everything and everyone is measured. And if people would align themselves with God and surrender themselves to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, then guess what? Then you're vertically true, which means you begin to call those things evil that God calls evil. And you begin to call things good that God calls good. And you define what is right as God defines what is right, and you define what is wrong as God defines what is wrong. And your heart breaks for the things that break God's heart. And you celebrate what God celebrates, and you condemn what God condemns. Because once you've aligned yourself with God and surrendered to the Lordship of Jesus, then you were vertically true. And anything else, aside from the standard of God, is crooked. But see, our culture wants to persuade you that God is not the objective moral standard by which everything is measured. Our culture wants to try to convince you that man is the objective moral standard. And thus man determines what is right and wrong, and man determines what is good and evil, which is why we have such confusion now about everything related to examples, gender identity, the definition of marriage, laws protecting the unborn. They've all been rewritten or redefined by the culture to suit the culture. Now it was not always so. Our own founding document, the Declaration of Independence stated that the very basis for common law in America was derived from, quote, the laws of nature and nature's God. Now, what does that mean? That phrase is actually a legal term from the Blackstone commentaries on law, which was the standard for law in England and later in America. And from this legal textbook in volume one, section two, the laws of nature are defined, listen, as quote, the will of God for his creation as revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures. That's right in Blackstone's commentary. Our founding fathers adopted Blackstone's commentary as law for the standard by which our nation should be governed. In other words, when our founding fathers adopted William Blackstone's commentary on law and his definition, they believed that God and the Bible served as the plumb line for our nation and our nation's laws. But of course, in recent years, we have seen a swift erosion of that principle. And thus our culture is not vertically true. Every generation from the beginning of time has tried to determine right and wrong and good and evil apart from God, making man his own moral standard, and it is it has never gone well. Whenever man decides that mankind can just be his own standard instead of God being the standard, it never goes well. And our generation is no different. And that's why the Bible describes every generation, not just Paul's generation, every generation as perverse and crooked, because it's not vertically aligned with God as the true plumb line. Now, we we know this is true about our day. Paul said it was true about his day almost 2,000 years ago. That's what we just read in Philippians 2. And by the way, Moses, 1500 years before Paul said it about his generation. I'll just read to you from Deuteronomy 32, verse 5. Listen to what Moses said when the Israelites rebelled against God. Deuteronomy 32, 5. They have corrupted themselves. They are not his children because of their blemish, a perverse and crooked generation. The very words Moses used around 1500 BC that Paul used around 62 AD, that still define our culture today in 2026. So nothing is changed. That's the reality of our culture. And now, this is why Paul puts such emphasis on our witness and our testimony, because this is the reality of our culture. We live as every generation has lived in a crooked and depraved generation when they serve to use man as the standard for right and wrong rather than God. And so that's why Paul, in the rest of chapter 2 here, he says, the crooked and perverse generation needs your witness, needs your testimony. But in order for us to be a good witness and to have a good testimony for Jesus in a crooked or perverse generation, we must be vertically aligned with God ourselves. And that's why Paul puts this emphasis on how we should conduct ourselves, because our lives are on display as representatives of Christ in the midst of this perverse and crooked generation. And so we must live up to this high calling. And so as you look here, look here in your Bibles in chapter 2, because as you look here, this is what he says about our conduct. Look again at verse 12. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence. So you can circle the word obey. He's saying to this church, and by extension, he's saying to us, but he's saying to this church, he goes, Listen, when I when I was with you, I noticed that you guys obeyed God. You guys, you guys were faithful and true. And I commend you for that. And in fact, that's why he refers to them also there in at the beginning of verse 12 as my beloved. You can just see his heart towards them. He goes, Man, I love you guys. When I was with you, because he established this church 10 years earlier, when I was with you, you guys were obedient to the Lord, you were faithful in your witness. And he goes, Let me tell you, you gotta be even more obedient and faithful to Jesus in my absence, because I can't always be there to hold your hand. And you have to know Jesus yourself and walk with Jesus yourself, because the world, a crooked and perverse generation needs your witness. So now more than ever, you need to be pressing into the Lord and being obedient to him. So he commends them on the one hand. He goes, You guys were always faithful. He says, But I need you to continue to be faithful because this generation needs your witness. And then he says, in the rest of verse 12, and I'm gonna talk about this just briefly, because this this becomes an issue for some people to try to understand. He says in the rest of verse 12, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for his good pleasure. So what does it mean that we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling? Well, well, first let me tell you what it doesn't mean. It doesn't mean that we have to work to earn our salvation. Paul is not writing to unbelievers here. He is writing to believers. In other words, we work outward what God has worked inward, and we do it with fear and trembling. In other words, we live out our faith out loud with a holy reverence for what God has done in us. So it is the outward display of the inward work of God. That's what all it's saying here. It's it's not saying you gotta, you gotta work, you know, your works have to, you know, get you saved. He's saying, look, you're already saved. He says, but I just want you to put feet to your faith, like walk it out, live it out loud, let people see it, let it be evident. What God has done inward, you and I need to express outward. That's what he's saying here. Everybody understand this. Our faith has to be lived outward, out loud. When I hear people from time to time say, Well, you know, my faith is private. I just want to throw up. Because what does that, what does that mean? I just, my faith is private, you know, I don't really talk about it. Well, either you're embarrassed or ashamed, and get over both, because a crooked and and perverse generation needs our witness, and they will not see it through silent Christians. They will see it through Christians who live their faith out loud, but but then that that becomes a challenge, doesn't it? Because then, in order for me to live my faith out loud, I better be living in a right way, so that my witness is genuine and is real and is visible and tangible. I can't be messing around. I can't be playing with this whole Christianity thing. I gotta be serious about it, because this crooked and perverse generation needs to know what we have. So we have to live up to that. This is a high calling. This is a high standard. This is why Paul is saying, okay, look, as you've obeyed in my presence, obey when I'm not looking, because God's looking. So be faithful and true, even when your spiritual leaders are around. He goes, and then work out your salvation, like outwardly demonstrate what God has done inwardly in you. Live your faith out loud and be bold about this. Remember in Matthew 3, verse 8, John the Baptist said, bear fruit in keeping with repentance. Just like it should be visible, it should be, it should be noticeable. Jesus even said in John 15 8 by this my father is glorified that you bear much fruit, and so you will be my disciples. Like the evidence that we belong to Jesus will be by the fruit that is uh obvious in our lives. And then he adds here in in the passage in verse 14, he says, Do Do all things without complaining and disputing. Why does he throw that in there? Well, he throws it in there because he's saying to us, our witness is going to be ruined to people who are watching if we are just complainers. If we just complain about everything and argue about everything. If we're just gretzin about everything, it's going to ruin our witness. Gretzen, by the way, that's a Pennsylvania Dutch term. It just means it means whining and complaining about stuff. Don't be Gretzin. Because the rest of the world's going to look on at us, complaining and arguing and grretzing about everything, and they're going to be like, I don't want what you have, because I don't like the way you are. So Paul says, stop your complaining, stop your arguing. Verse 15, that you may become blameless and harmless children of God without fault. Blameless that are harmless. See, notice the world is described as crooked and perverse. But Christians should be described as blameless and harmless. Now that doesn't mean that we never sin. The idea behind blameless and harmless, the ESESV version of the Bible says innocent, NIV says pure. It's just this idea that we have to live by God's standard and show ourselves as belonging to Jesus, that he's our Lord, such that no one can really level any true accusations against us. That's the idea behind blameless. It's without accusation. It's not perfection. None of us are going to be perfect until we see Jesus, and then we will be in our glorified bodies in a perfect state. But it is to not give place to any accusation, to be blameless, to be harmless, to be pure, to be innocent, to just be living in a right way that honors and glorifies the Lord. And then he adds there in the rest of verse 15, and shine as lights in the world. Shine as lights in the world. Now, some translations take the word lights and translate it stars. The actual Greek is luminaries, so it can mean light or stars. But I think one of the things that he's pointing out to us is another commentary on the condition of the world. Because you can't really shine. When do stars shine? I mean, stars are constantly shining, but when are they visible? When it's dark. As when you can see them. Okay, well, what he's saying by inference is we live in a dark world. And so it should be visible. We should be shining the light of the Lord in a dark culture, in a dark world. Turn on the light. Remember, Jesus said in John 3 19, he said, This is the verdict. Light has come into the world, talking about Himself. But men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. And so Jesus said a lot of people don't want to come into the light for fear that their evil deeds will be exposed. But you know, look, there's something very healing about being exposed. Like once and for all, just coming clean and letting the Lord just forgive you and give you a new heart and give you a new life. But there's this reluctance among a lot of people to want to step into the light, because like, ah, I don't want people to know. Hey, God already knows. And because God already knows, listen, he died on the cross for all that he already knows. That includes every sinful thing we've ever thought or said or done. Jesus loves us so much, he died on a cross for all the shameful things of our lives. Every sin we've ever committed. And so step into the light. Don't give place to the darkness. But then at the same time, now, once you've received Christ, he wants us to reflect him in this world. And that's why he says in Matthew chapter 5, verse 16, let your light so shine before men that they might see your good deeds and glorify your Father which is in heaven. So you know, we need to be shining the light of Jesus. Let your light so shine. That men are going to look on you. People are going to look on your life and go, wow, there's something awesome about your life. And then you're able to share Jesus with them because you're just letting your testimony be visible. Peter would write in 1 Peter 2, 11 and 12. He said, Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and strangers in the world. Ever feel like an alien and stranger in the world? Yep, like you're out of place. To abstain from sinful desires which war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans, among unbelievers, that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. It's just this whole idea of living your faith out loud. Let it be visible. Let your light so shine, Jesus said. Peter writing here, they may see your good deeds, glorify your Father on the day he visits us. So we live in a dark world. Let your light shine, reflect Jesus to a lost and dark world. And all of this that he writes here, you see, is both a warning and a calling. It's a warning and a calling. It is a warning about the crooked and perverse world in which we live and how we must make sure that there is nothing crooked and perverse in our own lives. And it is a calling to shine forth Christ and to be vertically true to God. That's what he's saying here in this passage. He's saying this generation is crooked and perverse. It is true about every generation since the fall of man in the garden of Eden. And because we live in a perverse, crooked, and dark world, he says, I want you to guard your hearts and live your lives in such a way that reflects Jesus well, that we are vertically aligned to God, that we are submitted and surrendered to Jesus as our Lord, and that we make an impact with our witness in this world. And that will bring great joy to people, great joy to our own hearts, and no doubt bring great joy to the heart of God. So do not give in to the philosophy of this age. Do not give in to the customs of the culture where it conflicts with the plumb line of God and his word. Paul would write in Colossians 2 8, see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. Paul would also write in Romans 12, too. But be transformed by the renewing of your mind. And then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will. Now, did you hear one word there? Do not be conformed any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed. Do not be conformed, but be transformed. The mission and message of this world is for you to be conformed to it. And this world is aggressively going after you and your children to try to conform you to its image, to its principles, to its standards, to its values. But much of our culture is not aligned with God. And therefore our mission is very opposite of the world's mission. Whereas the world is saying, be conformed, and don't ask any questions. We're smarter than you, just do what we say. The message of the church to the world is be transformed, be changed through a wonderful personal encounter with the Lordship of Jesus Christ. And when you're aligned with God and His Word, oh, it brings such joy. Joy to the hearts of those who understand the truth and the standard of God and a relationship through his Son Jesus Christ. Now look, as perverse or crooked as this generation is, there will come a day when the Lord will return. And Isaiah the prophet wrote this in Isaiah 40, verses 4 and 5. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill brought low. The crooked places shall be made straight and the rough places smooth. The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken. So, church, let your witness impact your world for the glory of God. Amen. Amen. Let's pray together. Father in heaven, we thank you for your word today for the challenge that Paul gives us here in the letter to the Philippines. Melphous, Lord, to shine forth you as we hold out the word of God, the truth to a crooked and perverse generation. We've been a part of this crooked and perverse generation. You've rescued us. You've redeemed those who know you as Lord and Savior. You have delivered us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son that God loves. And so thank you, Lord, that you've rescued us. We pray that we might have a shining testimony. We know we're not perfect, Lord, and we need your grace every day. But help us to be a shining testimony of your grace and of your love and of your truth in a crooked and perverse generation, that others might know the same redemption that we know, the same cleansing work, the same forgiveness, the same new life that we have through faith in Jesus Christ. So make us aware, Lord. We are always on display, representing you. Help us, Lord, that we might represent you well in Jesus' name. Amen and amen. God bless everybody. Have a great day.
