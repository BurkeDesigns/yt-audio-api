  "transcript": "Living quiet Christianity? Or courageous Christianity? Do we act one way around one group of people in a different way around another group of people? Or are we consistently the same person no matter who we may be around? Galatians chapter 2 is where I'm going to read verses 11 to 16. So follow along as I read. This is Paul writing. And he says this in verse 11. Now, when Peter, that's the Apostle Peter, had come to Antioch, that's in Syria. Paul says, I withstood him to his face because he was to be blamed. For before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles. But when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy. Paul says, but when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, if you being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles, and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law. For by the works of the law, no flesh shall be justified. Let's pause there and pray. Lord, it is good to be here in your house today. And I thank you for all those here and those watching online and those who will later listen to this Bible study. We just want to just settle our hearts before you today, Lord, and ask that you would speak to us now through through this passage, even as you said, Lord, to the seven churches in Revelation, he who has an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says. And that's really our desire every time we read your word, Lord, that we would have ears to hear what you would say to us today. So speak to us and encourage us and challenge us where we need it, as you know we would need it, Lord. And we're just thankful that we can be here in your house today. And we just ask you to bless this time in your word now. It's in Jesus' name we pray. And everybody said, Amen. You will remember from last week if you were here, if you weren't here, just to bring you up to date with the context of the letter to the churches in Galatia. Um there was trouble in these churches in Galatia. Galatia was a province located in ancient Asia Minor, which on a map today would be Turkey. And uh these were churches that Paul had planted during his missionary journey through this province of Galatia, but a problem crept into these churches after Paul had left, and the problem was the influence of a group of people known as the Judaizers. Now, the Judaizers were Jews who did believe that Jesus is the Messiah and that the way to salvation is through faith in Jesus as the Messiah. However, the Judaizers didn't know what to do with the Mosaic law, and so they imposed the law on top of knowing Jesus as Lord and Savior, and that's how they thought one was really a true Christian. You had to believe that Jesus was Lord and Savior, and you had to follow all the rituals and rules of the Jewish traditions of the Mosaic law. And thus the Judaizers were teaching things like it's Jesus plus guys have to be circumcised. It's Jesus plus the feasts and the festivals. It's Jesus plus, you have to keep kosher, eat just the right foods. And so Paul writes this letter to the churches of Galatia to uh correct this erroneous teaching that has crept into these churches. And Paul is gonna make it clear here that we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. You can't add to that or improve it, and the minute you do, you've just made it a works-oriented religion. And so one of the linchpin verses of Galatians is right here in chapter two. We read it a moment ago. Just glance again at verse 16, where Paul says in verse 16, a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. He says, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. Now he uses that word justified several times there, so let me just give a quick definition. When when a person trusts Jesus as Lord and Savior, and by faith you you put your trust in him, what he did on that cross, you ask him to forgive you of your sins to come into your life, you are justified before God. What does that mean? It means that God no longer sees us positionally as the sinners that we are, but he sees us through the righteousness of his son, and thus we are justified, and as far as God is concerned, the way he views us, it's just as if I'd never sinned. Okay? That's a working definition for justified at no extra crossed, friends. Okay. It's the idea that when God looks at us, he looks at us through the righteousness of his son that was imputed to us by faith, and so in that sense, it's just as if I'd never sinned, even though we're still sinners, even though as a Christian we still have to battle with the desires of the flesh, we have to die to self daily and be obedient to Christ. As far as position goes, God sees us through the righteousness of his son, and it's and we're justified in in his sight. And Paul says here, obeying the rules and the regulations never justified anybody. He said, The only way we're justified is through faith in Jesus Christ. So he is combating this erroneous doctrine of the Judaizers that has crept into the churches of Galatia. And sadly, the influence of the Judaizers has even rubbed off on the apostle Peter. Because Paul rebukes him here in this letter. Now it isn't that Peter necessarily believed that it was Jesus plus in order to be saved, but it was simply the influence of the Judaizers had rubbed off on Peter such that he became intimidated by their influence. He became intimidated into living what I'm calling today for our study, quiet Christianity. So he was intimidated to start living quiet Christianity in front of Gentiles. That is that Peter didn't want to fully live in the freedom of Christ as a Jew for fear of what his Jewish brothers would think. And his silence, coupled with his withdrawal from the Gentiles, because he literally like stopped hanging around the Gentiles whenever his Jewish friends would come around. Okay, so his silence along with his withdrawal from the Gentiles gave this impression, sent a message that he must believe what the Judaizers are teaching. Because otherwise, why would you withdraw from the Gentiles? If you think the Gentiles are fully accepted in Christ without having to obey all the regulations and rituals of the Mosaic law, then why are you withdrawing from them? And if you're withdrawing from them, are you believing that what the Judaizers are saying is true? And by his example, he was sending this mixed message. And so that's why Paul rebukes him here in verse 11. Look again in your Bibles, where Paul just says, I withstood him to his face because he was to be blamed. I mean, Paul's very direct here. He's like, he isn't like, I think he's wrong. He's like, he is wrong, and he is to be blamed, and I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed. I think the message Bible says something like, I got up in his grill because he was clearly tripping. So Peter was. Peter was tripping. He's like, uh Paul's like, what are you doing, bro? Like, like, why are you withdrawing from these Gentiles just because your Jewish friends come around, and you as a Jew now all of a sudden get all kosher? And so he rebukes him about this. And why? Why was Peter acting like this? Well, there's there's a key word in verse 12. Look at your Bibles. I'll explain the whole verse, but then I'll point out the key word. Verse 12, for before certain men came from James, he, that's Peter, would eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, here it is, fearing those who were of the circumcision. Fear. Peter was afraid of what other people would think. Fearing the circumcision. So that's just a term that means the Jewish brothers, okay? But let me explain verse 12, because he talks about here when he says, when um certain men came from James. Now, James was the leader of the church in Jerusalem. So there were Jewish believers in the church in Jerusalem who went to Antioch in Syria to visit Peter. And Paul observed this, that when those Jewish brothers came from Jerusalem to Antioch to visit Peter, that's when Peter pulled away from the Gentiles and acted all kosher, and he's just like, Yeah, I'm just gonna hang out with my Jewish buddies, and I don't even really know these Gentile guys. Um, but and so he pulled away like this, and why? Because Paul says he was fearing them. He was afraid of what other people would think about him socializing with the Gentiles and about his freedom. In Christ himself, to not have to be kosher and to not have to obey all the rules and regulations, even as a Jew. Now, what is so odd about this is that Peter was the very person that God tapped to bring the message to the Gentiles the very first time the Gentiles came to faith in Christ. The story is in Acts chapter 10. You don't need to turn there, but I'll summarize it. Many of you are familiar with this story. There's a guy in Acts 10 by the name of Cornelius. He is a Gentile. And he's not just any Gentile, he's a Roman officer. He is a centurion, meaning he was over a hundred soldiers. And so he is like the worst of the worst in the eyes of a Jew, typically in that day, because he's Gentile, so he's dirty, he's unclean, and he's a Roman officer. And the Jews of that day in Israel saw the Romans as a threat to their peace and sovereignty. That's why most Jews were looking for a Messiah who would overthrow the Roman government. That's why many Jews were disappointed in Jesus, because Jesus came to do something bigger than just overthrow the Roman government. And when he didn't do that, some of the Jews are like, oh, you're not our Messiah. And so there was long-standing animosity towards Gentiles in general, particularly a Gentile who's a Roman officer. But it is that guy, Cornelius, to whom God calls Peter to go share the message of the gospel. Now, Peter, being a Jew, is not used to going to the house of a Gentile. So he has to be persuaded that this is a good thing to do. And in Acts 10, it tells us that Peter, one time when he was in prayer, God gave him a vision. And in the vision, there was a sheet, just like a bedsheet being lowered down from heaven, and inside the bedsheet were all kinds of unclean animals. Animals that Jews were not supposed to eat. So it doesn't really say, you know, exactly, but you know, I'm thinking pork chops and shrimp, you know, there's like a lot of beautiful things in this bed sheet, right? And in Acts 10, the Lord speaks to Peter and says, get up and eat. And Peter says in Acts 10, 14, not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common or unclean. Like I'm fully kosher. I've been a good boy. I don't eat that unclean, dirty stuff. And in the vision, God responds by saying, What God has cleansed, you must not call common. And it was God's way of showing Peter that his animosity or his reluctance at least to go into the home of a Gentile, that Peter needed to realize that Jesus died for all, both Jew and Gentile, and that he was never to see Gentiles again as unclean, uncommon, or outside of the bounds of God's amazing grace. But this was new for Peter as a Jew. And so he's he has to be taught this by the Lord, that Jesus died for all, that all might come to repentance, that all might be saved. So Peter goes. He's obedient, and he goes to the house of Cornelius, and he shares the gospel, and Cornelius and his whole family get saved and filled with the Holy Spirit, and it is a wonderful new day in the kingdom of God. Because now Gentile believers have been ushered into the family of God for the very first time. And this is so unusual that the gent that the Jewish leaders gathered together in Jerusalem to discuss this. And they were like, Well, we gotta we gotta decide, are there certain regulations we need to impose upon them because these Gentiles don't even, a lot of them even know the commandments, so we're gonna have to tell them a bunch of the rituals and regulations, and we gotta get them up to speed so they can be somewhat Jewish as these Christians. Peter in Acts 15 actually gets up and defends the Gentiles. And he tells his fellow Jews, you guys are imposing heavy burdens on them that we can't even bear. I'll read it to you, it's brief, but it's Acts 15, 7 to 11. It says, and when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them, Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago, God chose among us that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. So Peter's like, remember, I'm the one that God used in the house of Cornelius. And he says, So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. And he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now, therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, meaning the new believers who are Gentiles, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear. He says, but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved in the same manner as they. So Peter even defends the fact that these Gentile converts have come into the family of God. And he says, we can't impose all these rules and rituals on them. This is by grace that we're saved, and the Holy Spirit will begin to show us what's right and wrong. Yes, of course, we have scripture as well, but we're not to impose all the feasts and the festivals and circumcision and kosher and all this stuff. He says, We can't even live up to all this stuff. It's by grace are we saved. The Holy Spirit brought them in to the family as much as the Holy Spirit brought us in. So when we're here in Galatians chapter 2, it's about 10 years after that speech that Peter gives. And in those 10 years, Peter has waned a little bit in his confidence about the Gentiles, at least in terms of what his Jewish brothers think of those Gentiles. And Peter has allowed the opinion of his Jewish brothers to influence him such that he withdraws and pretends like he doesn't even know them. And Paul calls him out on this. This is why Paul says, basically, and I'm paraphrasing, he's like, he's like, Peter, bro, come on, bro. He's like, man, you love to hang out with the Gentiles when your Jewish friends aren't around, and you're eating with them, pulled pork barbecue and shrimp wrapped with bacon and Jimmy Dean sausage, and you know, you're you're like living it up. You're you're hamming it up, all right? It's a little pun there. Uh you're hamming it up with all them, and you're having fun, but then all of a sudden your Jewish buddies show up, and now you act all kosher, like you don't even know these Gentile brothers. And he says, You're a hypocrite. He calls him to his face. He says, You're a hypocrite. Look at verse 13. Paul says, and the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy. Now, Barnabas was Paul's traveling companion on his missionary journeys. And Paul says, all y'all lost your minds. He's like, you're you've this Judaizer thing has infiltrated the Jewish mindset, and you guys, you, Peter, you're you're living this quiet Christianity where you're one way with one group of people, you're another way with another group of people. You've you you've persuaded other Jews by your example, and even my traveling buddy Barnabas has been led astray with your hypocrisy. Now, look, I'm not coming down on Peter because he serves as a great example for all of us. He has great strengths and he has some weaknesses, and he's the perfect picture of every single one of us. And Peter's flesh has been visible throughout the gospels. This guy has a long rap sheet of fleshly things he's done. Right? He was the one who rebuked Jesus to his face when Jesus said the Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, be crucified three days later, he's gonna rise from the dead. And Peter's like, No, you won't. Not on my watch, you won't be dying. And he's rebuking Jesus out of the flesh. Remember, Peter was also the one that tried to walk on water, got his eyes off of Jesus. I commend him that he got out of the boat. Nobody else did, but as soon as he took his eyes off Jesus, he began to sink. He was also the guy at the Last Supper, when Jesus said how you all will betray me. And Peter's like, these guys might, but not me. I'm I'm not gonna betray you. And it was only a few hours later that he's but you know, denying him, sorry, not betrayed, that's Judas. Deny. He denied him three times, three times before the rooster crowed, so he didn't even live up to his own vain confession. And then Peter's also the guy that when Jesus was being arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, takes out a sword and starts cutting off the ear of the high priest, you know, just doing stuff in the flesh. And now we still see him operating a little bit here in the flesh, only this time it's coming out as quiet Christianity, living in such a way that you are timid around certain people for fear of what they will think. And hear me on this, Peter's hypocrisy should confront all of us at some level. Are we living quiet Christianity or courageous Christianity? Do we act one way around one group of people in a different way around another group of people? Or are we consistently the same person no matter who we may be around? Are we ti are we timid during the week, but then bold on Sundays? And this is why Paul called this kind of behavior hypocrisy. And I think probably at some point we've all been guilty of this, where we're not only not true to ourselves, we're not true to God. If we act one way around some people and a different way around others. Now, let me let me say this to make this clear. There is a difference between being sensitive around some people who do not share our liberties as Christian, and I'll define that in a minute, versus being embarrassed around people who do not share our beliefs as Christians. So in the first group, the Bible. The Bible actually instructs us to curb our conduct sometimes if we are sensitive to what might possibly offend someone or stumble them. And particularly in the context of Romans and 1 Corinthians, Paul writes about as Christians, you don't want to stumble other Christians. You don't want to set a bad example for non-Christians either. But in the context of there are some liberties that we all have that because there are certain actions or activities or behaviors that are not clearly defined in Scripture as right or wrong. And in those cases, what the Bible says is we have to rely on our sanctified conscience. And so when we defer to our sanctified conscience for ourselves, is this okay for myself or not? We have to be sensitive that if it's okay for us, it may not be okay with another brother or sister. And so therefore we need to defer to them, and we need to be sensitive and we curb our conduct so that we don't stumble someone or offend someone. This is what Paul wrote in Romans 14, 13. He said, Therefore, let us not judge one another anymore, like what I might find as liberty, you may not, but I can't judge you if you don't, but rather resolve this not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother's way. So he's saying, be sensitive. Now, in Romans 14, when Paul wrote that, he's talking about a time during which the Roman Empire ruled, and there was a lot of idolatry, and there was a lot of paganism, and even food and drink was often offered to these false gods by the Romans. Paul will add in 1 Corinthians 8 13, therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble. What he's talking about that there is that in the meat market, the Romans would sell meat that had previously been offered as a sacrifice to these false gods, and some Christians were coming along in the meat market going, I don't want to touch this hamburger because it's been offered to Poseidon or some other God. And Paul was like, you know, look, these aren't real gods anyway. You're free to eat the meat, unless your conscience convicts you, then don't. But at the same time, if you have the freedom to eat that meat, and another brother doesn't, don't invite that brother to your house for dinner and serve him that hamburger, because you're gonna be offending them, you're gonna be stumbling them. So curb some of your behavior in deference to, in love for a brother or sister. You don't have to always exercise your liberties and your rights. Okay, that's different, and that's noble, and that's what the Bible tells us we should do. Versus, the problem here in Galatians 2, where you're not sensitive to somebody based on liberties, but you're embarrassed in front of somebody because of who you are in Christ. And that's what was happening with Peter here. He was a man of flesh like you and I, and he, in this, in this brief moment of his life, is separating himself from the Gentiles because he's more afraid about what his Jewish brothers are thinking about his liberties and about how Gentiles don't need to follow the rules and regulations of the Jewish Mosaic law. And so he becomes a different person depending on who he's around. And there's a big difference between being set being sensitive around people who may not share your liberties and being embarrassed around people who don't share your beliefs. Listen to what Paul said about this in Romans 1.16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For it is the power of God for salvation to all who believe, first the Jew and then the Gentile. He said, I'm not ashamed of this. We cannot be ashamed or embarrassed, and then just slowly become these quiet Christians. Paul would also write to young Timothy in 2 Timothy 1 8. He says, Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God. And listen to what Jesus said in Matthew 10, 32 to 33. These are strong words. Therefore, whoever confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven, but whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. This is challenging. And here is our challenge, okay? I'm gonna summarize all of this in like a sentence. Here it is. Our challenge as followers of Christ is to be unashamed and unafraid to live for Christ consistently, no matter where you are or who you are with, because that is courageous Christianity instead of quiet Christianity. That's what he calls us to. So I'm gonna say it again. It is to be unashamed and unafraid to live for Christ consistently, no matter where you are or who you're with, that's courageous Christianity. You know, in the animal kingdom, chameleons are really interesting creatures, aren't they? And um they're part of the reptilian family, and they have this wonderful ability that God has given them to shift the colors and to just change colors, and they they adapt to their surroundings, and they can shift colors at will and blend in to their environment. And it is a wonderful quality that God has given that particular animal and the animal kingdom, but unfortunately, it is not a quality that Christians should demonstrate. And there are a lot of chameleon Christians who adapt to their surroundings by blending into their environment such that you wouldn't even notice them. And it is rooted in a desire to be liked or to fit in. It just is. And so, how do we overcome this fear and go from quiet Christianity to courageous Christianity? Because that's what it is. It really is fear. It's the fear of what people think or the fear of not being liked or fitting in. Take your pick, it's rooted in fear. And so, how do we overcome this? Well, I'm I'm gonna take the word fear, and I'm gonna use it as an acronym to teach us together what we should be about. And so here is the first letter in the word fear. F is follow the example of Christ. We want to overcome quiet Christianity, we have to follow the example of Christ. What was the example of Christ? He socialized with everyone and was consistently the same, whether he was ministering to prostitutes or having dinner with Pharisees. He wasn't one way with some people and another way with others. He was himself consistently with the poor and the rich, with the lame and the healthy, with the fishermen and the centurion, with the unbelievers and his followers, with Jews and Gentiles, in public and in private. Number two, the E in fear is we have to expect that not everyone will like you. Listen, the truth is they already don't. I mean, who are we kidding? There people, look, Christianity is not a popularity contest, so don't go around hoping people will like you. Because they already don't. And they will like you to your face, and then you turn around, they stab you in the back. Because that's the human nature. People are fickle, they will like you one minute and then despise you the next. Isn't that what they did with Jesus? They loved him one minute, and then they're crucifying him the next. Just look at the final week of Jesus' life. He comes into Jerusalem riding on a donkey, and people line the streets of Jerusalem, giving him a hero's parade. They're throwing down their cloaks in the street in front of him as he's coming along riding on this donkey, they're waving palm branches and laying down palm branches. They're treating him as a king, and they shout in John 12.13, Hosanna, Hosanna to the to the Lord to the king in the highest. They said, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the king of Israel. They're calling him the king of Israel in John 12, 13, and just a few days later they are shouting for his crucifixion. And what did he do? He was loved and liked one minute, and he was hated and despised the next. That is the fickle nature of human beings. And if you sit around trying to be liked by people, that is exhausting, and it'll never happen. You'll have friends who love you and like you, and you'll have people who pretend they love and like you, and they and then you will have people who despise you. And it is exhausting, and it is not our place to try to be liked by everybody. And that usually causes compromise in our own hearts, because we're more interested in being liked by people than loved by the Lord. We're more interested in pleasing people than pleasing the Lord. And Paul told us last week in our study in Galatians 1, verse 10. He says, Do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bond servant of Christ. So we we can't be people pleasers. We have to be God pleasers. So we we have to expect the reality that not everyone will like us, and that's okay, as long as the Lord likes and loves us. We just want to honor him and please him. But this is the reason why we often resort to quiet Christianity, because we're too preoccupied with people liking us. Number three, the A in fear is we have to ask God to make us bold. You know, at the early church, they gathered together a few different times, Acts chapter two, and again in Acts chapter four, and they prayed a bold prayer. And the prayer was, Lord, make us bold, make us courageous. And this is what it says in Acts 4:31. And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken, and they were all filled. With the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. God emboldened them because they prayed and asked God for that. And remember, this is first century AD. They're asking, Lord, make us bold during a time in which Christians are being martyred by the tens of thousands. Like to be bold in the first century meant my head might be cut off. So what's holding us back today in the comfort of America for being bold for Christ. What's holding us? Oh, they might unfriend us. No. Oh no. It's going to unfollow me now. My likes are going to tumble. I don't know how to handle this. Like, please, like, nobody's cutting your head off. Like, what's holding us back from being bold? I love this in Psalm 138 3. This can be our prayer. In Psalm 138 3. In the day when I cried out, you answered me and made me bold with strength in my soul. That's Psalm 138, verse 3. In the day when I cried out, you, Lord, answered me and made me bold with strength in my soul. So ask him. Say, Lord, make me bold for you. Make me courageous for you. The last letter in the word fear is repent. We have to repent for wanting to the approval of man more than the approval of God. We've all been there. We've all at times been more concerned about what somebody else thinks than what God thinks. But that's sin. Because then that's elevating the approval of man over our desire to have the approval of God. So we have to repent of that. We have to say, Lord, I'm sorry. Lord, I'm sorry. I've wanted the approval of men more than the approval of you. I've I've been more afraid of what people think than what you think. I've been self-conscious and I've been a quiet Christian. Lord, make me a bold Christian. Embolden me to be courageous for your glory. Again, this is not to shame Peter. I thank God that Peter's life story is in the Bible for us, so we can see a man who was just an incredible asset to the kingdom of God that God used in an amazing miraculous ways, but he still had feet of clay, like we do. He still was a man subject to fleshly things from time to time, like we are. And Paul had to confront him about it. And I pray that his story would confront each of us about our own consistency as a Christian. Are we living quiet Christianity or courageous Christianity? I pray the latter in Jesus' name. Lord, help us in this regard. That we are not one way with one group of people in a different way with another group of people, but that we are consistent followers of you, unafraid, unashamed, unapologetic. Make us bold, Lord. We want to follow your example. You were consistently the same no matter who you were with. We can't expect people to always like us. That leads us to a path of quiet Christianity. We ask you, Lord, right now for boldness. Would you please embolden us to live in a way that is strong and courageous for you? And we repent of those times that we have allowed the approval of others to be more important than your approval. And it has silenced us in ways that have dishonored you and sinned against you. So forgive us, Lord, of our sin of quiet Christianity. And may we be bold for Christ. And may we take to heart this passage of Scripture to challenge us and to encourage us to be true to you consistently. We love you, Lord. Thank you that you first loved us and died on a cross for our sins. We praised you in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen. And amen. God bless you all.",
