  "transcript": "The enemy see Jesus through you. Because again, you might be the only Jesus, quote unquote, that people may see. And people need to see the Lord. And it's through you. It's the church. Second Kings chapter six. So we ended with last week. Pastor Austin ended in chapter six at the beginning, in verses one through six, or one through seven on one of Elisha's miracles, the floating axe head, and where we are in 2 Kings chapter 6, we're gonna pick it up in verse 8. And I just want to highlight again, just to reiterate the miracles that Elisha did are recorded for us here in 2 Kings. And what's interesting to me is that if you remember, right before Elijah would be taken up to heaven in a chariot of fire, okay, something that the writer of 2 Kings is trying to describe for us. But he's he's taken up, he's in a way raptured up to heaven. And Elisha witnesses this. Um before that happens, um, you know, Elisha, Elisha is blessed by Elijah, and he asks for a double portion of Elijah. And it's very interesting that when you read 2 Kings, um, God gave Elisha just that, a double portion. Roughly eight miracles are recorded that Elijah performed, and then roughly 16 miracles are recorded that Elisha performed. So he got a double portion. Um, in a way, uh he was blessed by the Lord, but he uh performed double the miracles that Elijah did. And they were all very interesting miracles that both of these prophets did. Um, but Elisha did many interesting miracles uh recorded in 2 Kings. And I just have on the screen, once again, we're gonna look at just several of them. We don't we haven't even covered all of the 16 roughly miracles he did. But the first one we know is the Jordan River was divided in chapter 2, verses 13. Uh, we've read Jericho's bad water was purified in chapter 2, verse 19. Number three, the widow's oil was multiplied, chapter 4. It's a great story. The widow's son was raised to life. That's a really fascinating story in in chapter 4. The poisonous stew was purified. Very interesting uh scripture. It's only three verses, but he did that miracle. The people's food multiplied in chapter 4. We see also uh number seven, Naaman, we talked about him last week, he was healed of leprosy in chapter 5. A great story uh in 2 Kings chapter 5 of Naaman, who I actually tend to think that we may see him in heaven. Um, you know, Jesus even mentioned Naaman in the New Testament, a Syrian, um, where he was making a point that you know the Jews and the Gentiles did not get along, and he he talks about, you know, Naaman the Syrian, a Gentile, um, you know, believe the Lord, in a sense. So um Jesus actually talks about him in the New Testament. Also, number eight, again, just going through these quickly, and there's a few more that we haven't highlighted, but number eight, Elisha's servant uh was given leprosy. That's kind of a miracle, all right? Not a good miracle for his servant, but miracle nonetheless. Number nine, the axe head floats, talked about that last week, uh, where a borrowed axe head fell into the water, and Elisha throws a stick and it comes back up, and they they get it. So, very interesting miracles. What we're gonna look at tonight is number 10, Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to the unseen realm. Number 11, we'll look at the Syrian soldiers' eyes are blinded, and then number 12, the soldier's sight are then restored. And if we have time, we'll get into much of number uh, I'm sorry, number 13, we will not get into tonight. We'll leave that for Pastor Gary. A dead man comes back to life. Very interesting. A dead man is raised back to life when Elisha is dead. If you've read the story, you can read ahead in chapter 13. But when uh when a dead body is laid on top of the grave and the bones of Elisha, the dead man is raised back to life. Very crazy weird story. What is not recorded that we don't have here on this list, um, I think is actually a really funny miracle. It's actually 2 Kings chapter 2. Um, when Elisha's first miracle is calling down bears to kill 42 teenagers. That's awesome. All right, Elisha was an awesome dude. Uh, why did he call 42 bears? It's because they called him bald, bald headed, baldy. We know Elisha was bald, so because of the youths, we have them to thank who got killed for making fun of Elisha's baldness. And Elisha says, Enough with these teenagers, and he calls down bears, and it says the bears maul them. Um that's I think pretty epic. Um anyway, that's a miracle that he did. So it's very interesting. But what we're gonna see today is starting in verse eight. In verse eight, let's pause, let's just want to pray first, and then we're gonna we're gonna dive into a lot of what scripture has for us. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much again for just bringing us here safely for the worship, for communion, for what you're doing in the life of your church. And God, now we want to hear from you from your word, that you would speak to us through 2 Kings, and that we see Elisha's ministry, how it was just a unique time period in Israel's history. Uh, Lord, but you used him for a purpose, and we want to glean from what your word says, and we want to apply that to our lives and not just read it, but do what it says, as James tells us. Not just to be hearers, but doers. So we love you, Lord, go before us now. We pray in Jesus' name, amen. Well, in chapter six, verse eight, I want to pick it up here in verse eight, and then I'm gonna read a bit and we'll we'll kind of dissect and look at what God has for us. In verse eight, now the king of Syria was making war against Israel, and he consulted with his servants, saying, My camp will be in such and such a place. And the man of God, this is Elisha, sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there. Verse 10. Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice. Therefore, the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing. And he called his servants and said to them, Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel? And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king, but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom. We'll come back to that. Verse 13. So he said, Go and see where he is, that I may that I may send and get him. And it was told to him saying, Surely he is in Dothan. And I'm gonna pause there and we're gonna continue looking at different principles that we see here in Elisha's miracles. And again, we ended last week that the axe had floating. If God can make iron swim, he can soften a hard heart. So if you weren't here for last week, that was the principle starting in chapter six. And we're introduced now here in verse eight to Jehoram as the king of Israel. So he's not named in here, but most scholars believe this is Jehoram himself. He was the son of Ahab, one of the wicked kings that Israel ever had. And Jehoram is king over Israel. And it tells us that there is um war between the Syrians and uh the Israelites, all right, the Hebrews, the people of Israel. And Syria, same Syria that is on our modern maps today, just north of Israel, Damascus is a part of Syria, but there Syria was a um a region north of Israel, and they were making war against Israel. It says that in verse 8. King of Syria was making war against Israel, and he consulted with his servants, and he said, My camp will be in such and such a place. They would um they would find territory to place their camp in, and they were, you know, encroaching on Israel and continuing to have this war with Israel. And so he tells his servants, all right, let's go place our camp here, and the next day let's go here, and let's go here. He was strategizing. But verse 9 tells us the man of God, who's Elisha, sent to the king of Israel to Jehoram. He said to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there. So, in a way, he's helping the king by giving us some insight that the Lord has given him. Hey, I know where the the king of Syria is going to place his camp this day or that day, and so don't go there, because that's where he's gonna be. And so the king of Israel followed Elisha. You know, the king of Israel respected Elisha. Um, and the you know, Israel was still in kind of a state of evil and sin. Um, but the the greater enemy of Syria, Elisha said, I, you know, I'm not gonna let them win, and we see Elisha is helping the king of Israel. And it says the king of Israel then, verse 10, send someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice. Therefore, the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled. Okay, so when the king of Syria is saying, I'm gonna strategize and let's go to let's place our camp here, then let's go here, they would he would find out that his plans were being thwarted, that the it was it's in a way that um the Israelis were one step ahead of them. It's like, oh, we're here, it's like, okay, well, they're over here, we gotta go somewhere else. And then they would be at that same place. And the king of Syria is thinking, what is going on? He basically thinks that there's a traitor in his army. Someone has to be telling Israel where I'm gonna be. Because this this doesn't make sense. I'm going here, I'm going there, and they happen to be one. Step ahead of me. And it says here at the end of verse 11, the king of Syria says to one of his servants, Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel? Basically, like which one of you is a traitor? Someone is spying and or a double agent, and something's not working out. This is this is not right. Which one of you is? And verse 12, one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet who's in Israel. He tells the king of Israel the words that you speak even in your bedroom. Isn't that crazy? That Elisha even knew the thoughts and the words of this king of Syria in the privacy of his own bedroom. That's kind of creepy. That's weird. Kind of tells you that God does know everything, and he used that tactic to tell Elisha everything that the king of Syria was trying to contemplate and strategize, even in the privacy of his own bedroom. Now, we don't necessarily know how the servants found out that, hey, it's Elisha. It's not one of us, it's actually Elisha. Maybe one of them overheard the people of Israel talking or Elisha's prophets, maybe they were, you know, camping or whatever, and and uh the Syrians spied on them. We really don't know. We're not told how they found out Elisha's the one who is hearing from the Lord and knows exactly where we're going. Um you know, to be honest, what what brings the Bible to life for me, because I'm such a visual person. Um I I really, you know, I grew up with veggie tales, I grew up with adventures and odyssey. Um, but what I've really liked, but this is the new generation of um Christian movies is super book. If you have not tuned into Super Book, it's by the 700 Club, which is CBN. Um you need to watch Superbook. I watch it with my kids, I like it more than them. All right, they're like, oh, super book again. I'm like, yeah, let's watch Super Book. It's great. Okay, there's an episode on this scene. It's very interesting. And they they're it's very accurate. They they they use scripture and they they visualize it for us uh, you know, 21st century people that you know can't really imagine. Well, they they do it for us. And so there's there's a great scene, and I have this in my mind of Elisha, you know, telling the king of Israel, here's what's going on, and maybe someone overheard that, and they told that back to the king of Syria. Look at verse 13. So he said, This is the king of Syria, go and see where he is that I may send and get him. All right, he wants to get Elisha. He's done with him. And it was told him saying, Surely he is in Dothan. Okay, you can underline this uh this city named Dothan, and you can also, in the margin of your Bibles, you can write down Genesis 37, 17. Dothan is an interesting city or town, really. Um it's only mentioned twice in the entire Bible. This is one of them. The other time that Dothan is mentioned is back in Genesis 37, verses 17. And it's the story of when Joseph is thrown in the pit by his brothers. That's the only that was in Dothan. That's the only time that we read about Dothan. Joseph being thrown in the pit and Elisha living there right now in Dothan. So it's it's north of Samaria. We know that. I'm gonna come back to that. It's in that region of northern Israel. That's that's Dothan, somewhat central northern Israel. And they find out he's in Dothan. Verse 14, therefore, he, the king of Syria, sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. So look what's happening. They they know where he's in Dothan, they come by night, they surround the entire city with chariots, horses, and an army. And verse 15, and when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army surrounding the city with horses and chariots. Okay, now this servant, if you will, this is this is a an unnamed servant. Uh, most likely it's not the same servant, uh, Gehazi that was in uh the earlier part of chapter five, the one that got leprosy. This is a new servant that um that Elisha has. He's not named, but it says in verse 15, when he, the servant, arose early and went out, you know, he's just probably going for a walk or just making sure everything's looking good. There was an army surrounding the city with horses and chariots. All right, so this is alarming. He's like, What is going on? What just happened? That they had no idea that that was happening because it was happening at night. So when he wakes up early in the morning, he sees the army, he's like, uh oh, this is not good. So he runs back in and he tells Elisha. Look at the end of verse 15. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master, what shall we do? Okay, you know, either Elisha's awake or he gets awake, you know, gets awakened by the servant. We don't know, but he is shouting, What are we gonna do? Verse 16, so he answered, this is Elisha. Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them. The servant's probably thinking, What are you talking about? You do so many weird miracles. It starts getting to your head, Elisha. Like, what is going on? What do you mean that those who are with us are more than those who are with them? And then verse 17, it tells us that Elisha prayed. Now, whether he prayed this out loud or not, we don't know. It's most likely he prayed it out loud. But he says here, look at this, all caps, Lord, it's Yahweh, I pray, open his eyes that he may see. Open his eyes that he may see. Now we're gonna see a miracle that he says that that happens right here because of a prayer. Open his eyes that he may see. Then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, the servant, and he saw. And what does he see to his amazement? It's amazing. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. Now that's interesting. So when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, and he said, Strike this people, I pray, with blindness. Okay, so here's what's happening. Uh the servant, the young man who's unnamed, tells Elisha, there's an army surrounding our city. This is Dothan. Uh, what are we gonna do? And why are they here? Um they're here for Elisha. They're here to seize him, or he maybe even kill him. And Elisha says some very encouraging, calming, inspiring words. Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them. For Elisha to say, Do not fear, it probably means that the servant was afraid. Every time you read do not fear, it usually from the Old Testament, but most likely the New Testament, you always hear that from an angel. Whenever an angel appeared to a person, they would always say, Do not fear. Why? Because it's it's very amazing, it's very brilliant, it's it's confusing. This is this is not, you know, this is not like my reality. I'm I'm looking into the supernatural. Then you get afraid. Um, and he says, Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see. Elisha prays that special prayer, and the Lord did just that. He answered his prayer, and he opened the eyes of the young man and he saw. And that would have been an interesting moment to see that. First, you are seeing just the physical, and then he is supernaturally looking into the unseen realm, the spiritual part, which is I tend to believe is more realer. That's even a word, more real than this place. Um, I do not believe that the spiritual realm or the unseen realm is a mystical um illusion, or like, you know, how Obi-Wan Kenobi is like a forced ghost when he dies, and he's just like this mystical spirit. Um, I I actually believe that the unseen realm or heaven or the supernatural is more real than we know, or it's more physical than we know. Um I don't understand why why we we have to, you know, grasp the supernatural part of the Bible, and we make it to seem very mystical and magical and and um just you know, because it is confusing, but it it's a it's real, it's tangible, it's physical. And we can't see it for some reason we cannot see into the unseen realm unless God does something miraculously and we can see it, like Isaiah would see the supernatural when he saw the Lord seated on the throne and he saw Seraphime. Um Adam and Eve were able to see the the supernatural realm uh before God kind of blinded uh the common person to see that. Um we see many um occurrences in the Bible of people tapping into the supernatural and seeing um the unseen realm. And you know, I can't explain it, you know. When you when, you know, I've read many books on um the spiritual, the supernatural, the unseen realm, and it's very fascinating, but it's it you get there's more questions than answers. It gets very confusing. Um but what I've learned and how I have studied um the supernatural or or you know the unseen realm, it it is more physical than than I really think. Um heaven is a real place, angels are real beings, demons are real beings. Um our Lord is a real, tangible son of God. Um, he's fully human, yet fully God. Um, and to see then the supernatural that Elisha could see. Now that's interesting too. Elisha was able to see it, but he's praying, not that he can see it, but that his servant can see it. Elisha already saw it, and that's pretty wild for him to be able to see not just the physical, but the supernatural, and at the same time. Now we know the Syrian army could not see that. They had no idea what was going on, and then the servant is able to see it, and he's he's amazed. And it says, Behold, and we're We're only told just this little description. The mountain, there must have been a mountain behind them, was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha, in a way protecting them, be you know, from the enemy. And that's all we get is it's a description of these chariots and horses of fire. Now, where's the last time we saw a chariot of fire? It's when Elijah was taken up or raptured to heaven in a chariot of fire. A chariot was a vehicle of transportation in that ancient world. Um that's the only way uh the writer of 2 Kings is able to describe what is happening. Um, do you do we think it was a literal chariot? Maybe. I possibly maybe don't think it is. I I actually think it may have been something that they're trying to describe, um, a some sort of supernatural way of transporting. Um, you know, you don't have to get weird when you when you read the Bible, but um a chariot of fire, I think is something that uh that the writer is trying to describe. When you read Revelation, um, when you read uh, you know, Isaiah trying to describe the supernatural, when John is seeing the supernatural in Revelation, he is trying to use terms uh in the best way that he can in his time period. Um so when he talks about seeing the four living creatures or the cherubim, and it had four faces, um, Ezekiel chapter one, it talks about the four living creatures, had wheels within wheels, it had eyes all around. When you read that, um they are trying their best they can to describe what they're seeing. And uh, you know, I you can Google all these crazy images of what you know we try to come up with of what it may have looked like, and I think we're way further than we really realize of what these magnificent supernatural beings may look like. Um, even the archangel Michael, um, no doubt, a you know, massive, brilliant angel. Um, and we really can't describe it. It's only given to us in the pages of God's word on the description that they tell us. So you see the mountain is full of horses and chariots of fire around. The point is, though, that God is bigger than any enemy out to get us. And this army of fire is surrounding Elisha and the servant to where the enemy is not going to touch them. Now the enemy doesn't see it. Once again, like I said, the enemy doesn't see it, they start advancing. When Elisha comes out, they start advancing. So look what it says in verse 18. So when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha then prays to the Lord. Okay, he prays, let my servant see the angelic army. He sees it. His second prayer now, this is the other miracle. He said, Strike this people, I pray, with blindness, the army. And God did just that, and he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. And now Elisha said to them, I love what he says. Look what he says, this is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, I'll bring you to the man whom you seek. All right, who are they trying to find? Elisha. I love what he does. He comes right out, and he says, This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, I'll bring you to whom you seek. He's a clever man. And he leads them, okay? He leads them. But what I love about this this first scenario before we keep moving on about Elisha praying that the servant's eyes would be open, so that he may see. Um, he was already seen physically, but he prayed that he could see supernaturally or spiritually. And I love what it actually says. If you want to highlight or circle it, I think you should. When it at the end of verse 16, he says, then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw, and he saw, and I love that. The Lord opened his eyes and he saw. The second point I want us to look at for principles of chapter six. Remember, God is present and working even when we can't see it. He is always there, and he's always working. He's doing a work, even when you and I can't see it. And he, you know, he gives us spiritual eyes so that sometimes we can always be reminded. Lord, you're you're doing something, you're working, and I may not see it. Um, and I know, you know, the Bible says we're two or more are gathered. I am there. He's present with us, though we can't see it, we can't see him. He's working and he's here. It's just a good reminder. Um, the Lord is near, and he is always near to the brokenhearted as well. So whenever you're feeling in depths of despair or you just feel like there's no way out, he's there, he's near, and he's doing a work. Um I'm not sure what work he needs to do in your life, but again, hindsight is always 2020. You can always see the way the Lord was working, and I think we will never realize all the things that God was doing to make everything work together like a puzzle until we get to heaven. And then we'll see, wow, that's what God was doing. Amen. I mean, we're seeing, we're just seeing a glimpse. And there's some things that don't make sense, there's some things that we don't understand, but God is working it out. And that's what Paul says in Romans. He works all everything out for good for those who love him and are called according to his purpose. He's working things out when we can't see it. And the servant couldn't see it until Elisha prayed. And then he says, Oh, wow, we are, we're protected. We're on the Lord's side. I want you to write down some of these verses. They're not on the slide, but take note of these. Ephesians 1 8, Ephesians 1 8. Paul says, I pray that your eyes of your heart would be open, that your spiritual eyes, the eyes that really matter to the Lord, would be open, and that you would see him for who he truly is. That's Ephesians 1 8. Romans 8 31, right write that down. Romans 8 31, it's this famous passage about if God is for us, who can be against us? God is for us. Who can be against us? There's no one powerful than the Lord, Almighty. And if he's for us, if he has our backs, uh, then no one can touch us. Um, do we still live in a fallen world? Yes. Um, we're still gonna hit bumps in the road, and you know, and if you give in to certain choices that are sinful and unholy, um, then you you may have to suffer some consequences. But for the most part, um, if if you've got the Lord and he's got you, and you're walking wholeheartedly in him, then greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Who can be against us? Write down 2 Corinthians 5 7. It's a famous passage. 2 Corinthians 5 7, Paul talks about we walk by faith, not by sight. We walk by faith, not by sight. We we don't see ahead, we don't know the unknown. God does, so we gotta trust him and walk daily, step by step in faith. I don't have all the answers. Man, I wish I knew the future, but I don't. Parts of me actually doesn't want to know the future, because I wonder if it would make me a little bit more different. I would I would act different, I would think differently. I would constantly worry. Oh, and I know this is gonna happen in 20 years. You're constantly worrying. I think it's a gift that God does not allow us to see the future. Um, but a lot of us are like, I wish I knew it, I wish I knew it. Sometimes maybe it's good that you don't. Um he's working, he's doing a work, but he says, I want you to walk by faith, because that's gonna mature you. That's gonna grow you in your relationship with the Lord. It's gonna build character. And so, 2 Corinthians 5, 7. I want you to also write down this last one for this point, 2 Corinthians 4, 17 through 18. 2 Corinthians 4, 17 through 18, Paul would mention that we fix on what we cannot see. We fix our eyes on the unseen, what we cannot see. For what we see is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. And Paul is always about just fixing your eyes on what you cannot see. Walk by faith, not by sight. Learn to learn to live this life as a Christian, not by what you see around you or your circumstances, because those are temporal. But that angelic army around Elisha and the servant, that's eternal. And Elisha says, God, I need you to, I need you to open the eyes of my servant so he can see this. And the Lord was gracious and did just that. Now, if you know me, you know I love movies and I like talking about movies, and I love, okay, so I've been doing that for a long time. Uh, one of my favorite movies growing up and still is today is Santa Claus with Tim Allen. I know it's not Christmas yet, but hey, it's you know, Christmas in June. Santa Claus, interesting quote, very, very prophetic word from an elf in Santa Claus. Her name was Judy. Judy the elf. And she says to Scott Calvin, who was played by Tim Allen. She says, seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing. I know, and it was about Santa, but Tim's like, I don't understand. And I actually think that is a very good biblical word, even though she didn't know it. Prophetic little elf Judy, who knew it? She says, seeing isn't believing, believing is seen. And Jesus even said that. He said to his disciples before he would ascend back into the to his father's house. He said, You believe because you have seen me. Like you believe me because you've seen me, but blessed are those who have never seen me and yet believe. And that's us. I've never seen the Lord. I don't think I have. I hope, you know, I did, maybe in it, maybe in a dream. I really don't know. But he says, You are blessed because you still believe me and yet have not seen. So cling to that, church. Walk by faith, not by sight. I want to continue to read. He prays in verse 18, we just read this. Now he says, Lord, strike the people now with blindness. So here's what's happening. He strikes them with blindness, the Lord does, according to the word of Elisha. And this whole Syrian army is blind. And it says here in verse 19 now Elisha said. Hey, this is not the way. I'll show you to the guy you're seeking. Follow me. All right. Now, first of all, you've got to be thinking, well, they're blind. How are they going to follow him? All right. Maybe they're just, you know, have a long rope. Maybe they're doing show, you know, the, I was gonna say the macarina, that's not the macharina. The train, if you will, like dancing with, you know, holding, whatever. Okay. They're being led. The point is they're being led, and look what it says. He led them to Samaria. Now, if you're taking note, Dothin, where they are right now, is 12 miles north of Samaria. Um, 12 miles. So he leads them south to Samaria on this walk. And, you know, I I looked it up. How long would it take to walk 12 miles? And roughly it's about a four-hour walk. Four hours from Dothan to Samaria, that Elisha is leading these are this army of Syria blind. And he leads them, all of them. And they gotta go down. I mean, these guys are humbled. They're like, what is going on? We got we were defeated, what is happening? Um, we just we're all blind. How does that happen? And they have four hours to contemplate their thoughts. They got four hours on this journey. Like, we gotta really think about what's going on. Um, maybe the God of Elisha is really real. Like, let's like they had four hours to think, four hours to think. What else what else are you gonna do? You just hold in the hands of the other guy. Be like, all right, let's go to Samaria. Let's see what was going on. They don't know they're going to Samaria. They think that they're going to see the man of God, which is Elisha. So look at verse 20. So it was when they had come to Samaria that Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men that they may see another miracle God performs. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and there they were inside Samaria. It's like, what are we doing here? And then they see Elisha. They see him. Now, verse 21. Here's the king of Israel. Okay, he's got them. Elisha leads them to Samaria. Samaria's the capital of Israel at that point. Israel's in the north, Judah's in the south, and they have him in Samaria. But it says, now when the king of Israel, this is Jehoram, saw them, he said to Elisha, My father, shall I kill them? All right, my he's not his real dad. He's just, that's a that's a respectful term. My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them? Like I'm ready to go. You just say the word, I'm trusting you. Should I kill him? Look at verse 22. But he answered, You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? He says, Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master. Verse 23. This is an awesome verse. Then he prepared a great feast for them. And after they ate and drank, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And so the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel. It's amazing story. Point number three, again, if you're taking notes, let the enemy see the Lord through you. These men, the Syrian army, had just received grace and mercy. I mean, there's so many points you can pull out of this chapter, and I just I just came up with that one. The enemy, whoever the enemy is for you, this enemy in this story, um, saw the Lord working through Elisha, that he was gracious and merciful. They could have easily killed these men. And they had every right to. And there's war, and and you know, Elisha has the Lord, and it's like, hey, we we can go ahead right ahead and kill him. The king of Israel is ready to do that. And Elisha says, No, you shall not kill them. He says, Set food and water before them. So don't even just not kill them. And we're not even going to release them yet. He says, Set food and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master. And so he prepared a great feast for them. It's an amazing thing. If you're taking note, write down Romans chapter 12, verses 20 through 21. I want to read it to you. Romans 12, verse 20 and 21. Paul would be quoting Proverbs, but he says here in Romans, if your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads. Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good. Romans chapter 12, verse 20. An amazing verse. What did he just do? He just showed compassionate compassion, love, grace, and mercy, all right there. And the enemy saw the Lord through him. Let the enemy, whoever your enemy is, and Jesus says, you know, we have enemies, because he says, pray for them. Um if they persecute you, they say all these false things against you, and it's because of him, really, not because of you. It's because you're a Christian. Um, whoever your enemy is in your mind, um, let them see the Lord through you. Um, continue to pray for them, continue to lift them up to the Lord. Um, it's okay to get mad, you know. Christians, we can we can get mad at sometimes, just don't take it out in your anger. Um, let the enemy see Jesus through you. Because again, you might be the only Jesus, quote unquote, that people may see. And people need to see the Lord. And it's through you, it's the church. And this and these enemies saw something different. Wow, they they actually were gracious toward us. No wonder it says they never came back to the land of Israel anymore. We're not coming back. You guys showed grace to us. You guys showed mercy, and we're we're actually grateful for that. We're not gonna, we're not gonna come back and raid and raid the city. Um, you can also write down in Luke 14, Jesus would talk about this. Luke 14, verses 12 through 13. He talks about it's a it was about a wedding, and he tells the host of the wedding. Um, he says, Don't invite like the the famous and the popular. Invite the lame, the crippled, and then he says, Invite the blind. Now, who are these men? They were just blind. They were blind, and then they get a feast at the table. And Jesus actually says, I want you to invite the blind to your table, and you're gonna be rewarded. That's Luke 14, verses 12 through 13. Then obviously, Matthew 5, 16. We talked about that on Sunday. Jesus says, Let your good deeds shine before others. They saw good deeds from Elisha right there, and they didn't deserve it. But the Lord allowed them to see these good deeds. Hopefully, maybe some of them came to the Lord. We just don't know, but it was a good testimony nonetheless. We're gonna still pick it up in verse 24, and we're gonna see how much time I can get through this. I'm gonna try to get through all of the rest of this chapter into chapter seven, and we'll we'll just continue from where we are. So, verse 24, let's pick it up. It says, And it happened after this, you know, this is sometime later, that Ben Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria. Okay. And verse 25, and there was a great famine in Samaria, and indeed they besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one fourth of a calf of dove droppings for five shekels of silver. All right, what are we talking about right now? This is getting this is getting juicy. Um, you've got this king of Syria again, again, um, most scholars believe it's the same king of Syria, but he is besieging Samaria, which is uh not the same as what he what they were doing earlier in the first part of chapter six, and it says that he went up and besieged Samaria, and there's a great famine. There's a great famine in Samaria, and the writer of 2 Kings is trying to describe how bad this famine is. And he uses these terms. He says, A donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver. Um, it's you know, I don't know when you're ever gonna need a donkey's head, but um, maybe in a good famine, you're gonna need a donkey's head, who knows? Um, and it says, and one fourth of a cab of dub dropping dove droppings for five shekels of silver. Now, I I did the math for you, I kind of looked it up. For for eighty shekels of silver and in today's money, that'd be around five hundred dollars for a donkey's head. Okay, that's nice. And then a cab of dove droppings for five shekels. That's about thirty bucks uh for dove poop. There you go. Now, um, dove chocolate is really good. Um we can imagine that this is dove chocolate, but now you're not gonna look at dove chocolate the same. In verse 26, it says, Then as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, Help my Lord, O king. And he said, If the Lord does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the wine press. And then the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your sons that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow. This is how bad the state of the people are in this famine. Verse 29, very gruesome, sad text. So we boiled my son and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, give your son that we may eat him. But she was hidden, she has hidden her son. Verse 30. Now it happened when the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes, and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and they're underneath, he had sackcloth on his body. Then he said, God, do so to me, and more also if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, remains on him today. Okay, what's going on? There's this serious famine to where the people now of Samaria have gone now to the unthinkable thing of cannibalism. Um, twisted time in Israel's history. Israel again um went through some dark, twisted times. And even the king himself is so shaken up about this. He tore he tears his clothes. It's a sign of remorse. Tears his clothes, and he has sackcloth underneath. He can't believe what he has just heard. Um the woman is crying out. Saying, you know, we it's it's not fair, like we gave up my son, and now she's hiding her son. Well, yeah, but it's probably because she's had a uh she's guilt stricken. Like, what am I doing? I can't do this. And she's crying out to the king for help. And the king's like, this is unthinkable. But look what he does. He he actually blames Elisha. And he says, God, do to me whatever you want. And he says, but I I can't stand this, Elisha, and if I don't have his head, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go insane. He wants Elisha dead. He's blaming Elisha. Like it's really Elisha's fault. Elisha's been just been nothing but a prophet and a miracle worker. And it says here, verse 32, but Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him, and the king sent a man ahead of him. But before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, this is Elisha, do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone? He's talking about the king. This son of a murderer sent someone to take away my head. Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him. He says, When you when you see the servant coming, like he knew this was gonna happen, he's like, Don't let him in. Um, shut him out, and the king's gonna come anyway. They want they want me dead. Verse 33. And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger coming down to him. And then the king said, Surely this calamity is from the Lord. And he says, Why should I wait for the Lord's uh for the Lord any longer? He's like, Elisha, this is all you, and I know this is the Lord that's doing this to us. Why should I wait on him any longer? Like, let's just give it up. Look at look at our look at the state of our of our people and what we're committing. Chapter 7 now starts here in verse 1. Then Elisha said, Hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord, tomorrow about this time a say of fine flowers shall be sold for a shekel, and two says of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria. But look at verse 2. So an officer, this is this is like a high ranking official to the king. So an officer on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God and said, Look, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, could this thing be? He's basically mocking God. And he says, and and Elisha said, In fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it. He's saying, in the next day, here's a miracle that's gonna happen. Um, the Lord is gonna do a work and you're gonna be able to eat again, and you just have to trust him, and all, you know, the economic uh is gonna turn around and it's gonna the economy's gonna turn around, it's gonna be great, and here's what's happening. You know, in 24 hours, this is gonna happen. But an official of the king doubts Elisha. And you know, he says, you know, I'm translating, can the can God even bless us from the windows of heaven? Like, is this really gonna happen? We don't believe you. So that's the officer. Now, you gotta take note of that because what Elisha prophesies about him comes to pass, and in a weird, unique way. He says, actually, in fact, you officer, I don't even know who you are, and you're just doubting God and mocking him. In fact, you shall see it with your eyes. You're gonna see this miracle, but you'll not eat of it. What do you mean I'm not gonna eat of it? What do you mean I'm not gonna be a part of this blessing? And if you're, you know, as we go on, I want to keep going into verse 9. Here's what here's what's happening. And then we're gonna see one last, one last point. Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. And they said to one another, why are we sitting here until we die? And if we say, We'll enter the city, the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we're gonna die also. Now therefore come, let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we shall live. If they kill us, we shall only die. They're basically saying, hey, let's go in, let's just see what's out there, because if they kill us, we're gonna die anyway. We have leprosy. Verse 5, and they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise, no one was there. Now remember, it says that the king of Syria, Ben Hadad, had besieged Samaria, had taken it over, had plundered everything. But when the lepers, these four leprous men go in, it says there was no one there. Nothing. Look what verse 6 says. For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians, it's a great miracle, to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses, the noise of a great army. And so they had said to one another, Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us. So look what it says, verse 7. Therefore they arose and fled at twilight and left the camp intact. Their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and they fled for their lives. Look what's happening. God sent this miracle with the noise that only they could hear, thinking that they were under attack. And they're like, We gotta get out of here. And it was it was a fake noise. God just whispered to them like a dog whistle, only they could hear it. And they're like, whoa, we gotta go. We're out of here. And when the lepers come in, they see and they're like, Whoa, there is tons of food and and all this stuff is here. Where is everybody? And they come in, and it says in verse 8, and when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went in into one tent and ate and drank and carried from it silver and gold clothing. Like these lepers are just living it up. It's like, hey, we're gonna die anyway, it's an incurable disease. We're gonna eat this food, we're gonna, we're gonna take the gold, we're gonna take the silver, we're gonna put clothing on. And it says, and they went and hid them at the end of verse eight. Then they came back and entered another tent, carried some from there also, and went and hid it. Verse 9. Then they said to one another, we are not doing right. Man, it's like, whoa, these lepers are guilt stricken. They're coming in and they're like, we can take all this, this is ours. You know, we're gonna die anyway. We might as well die looking nice and eating well. And they come in, and then they're like, you know what? Um, we're not doing a good thing. And here's why. Here's why they were guilt stricken. It's because remember, their their city of Samaria was in a famine. They're they're all, you know, dying. And they're like, We're we're living like kings. And we what are we doing? We're not doing right. And he says, look, look what they say to each other. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent. We remain silent. If you're taking note, I'm gonna end with this last point. I love what this principle is of chapter seven. Share the good news, don't stay silent. It's a good reminder from these four unnamed leprous men. They realize we have good news and we're keeping it to ourselves and we're not sharing it. You know, to apply that to our own lives, the gospel is considered the good news. And if we hoard it and keep it to ourselves and not share it, shame on us. Jesus wants us to proclaim the gospel, to make disciples of all nations, not to stay silent. And they realize we're not doing a good thing. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent. I'm gonna finish up what they say. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household. And so they went. They went and told the king and everything that had happened. And they realized, okay, um, this is happening, and we can go. But I want to close with with this good point. If if you know the gospel, um, it's the one thing that we're we're we're told in Psalms to hide it in our hearts, but we're also told to share it. So it's actually both. You're to hide it so that you may not sin, and then you're to share it so that others can hear it. Don't remain silent, don't be on the sidelines, and that we can take a lesson from these four leprous men. We we're not doing right. We've got good news, and we gotta share it. So if you feel guilty about that, and we kind of mentioned that on Sunday as well, as being a watchman. If you if you haven't done that yet or shared the gospel or you you feel timid, let the Lord minister to your heart. God's got you, he's gonna give you the right words, but share it with somebody. Share it with somebody this week that the Lord's put on your heart. Text them, email them, talk to them in person. But share the good news. Don't remain silent. You may just in fact plant the seed, water it, and then God's gonna make it grow. Amen. Amen. So let's bow our hearts, let's pray and just give this to the Lord. Father God, we thank you for tonight. We thank you for your word. We ask, Lord, by all these application principles that you would just speak to us, that we would hold dear your word, that we would hide it in our heart, that we may not sin against you, but that we would also share it with the common person that needs to hear it. And God, whatever person you've placed on each individual's heart in this room or watching online, let them make a way to text, email, talk to them in person, and share with them the good news that they have. And God, we we thank you for the gospel that it changes lives. And when we tell it to someone, we are blessed, um, no matter what how they respond. And so let us take a lesson from these four leprous men that they realized um we've got a good thing and we need to share it. Um let us be the same as well. We thank you for this word. We thank you, Lord, that you are God of the supernatural, and that we have to walk by faith, not by sight, and that you've got good plans for us, and that the enemy may see Jesus through us. So we love you, we praise you. Bring us back safely next time, and go before us now. In Jesus' name and everyone said, Amen.",
