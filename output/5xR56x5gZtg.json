  "transcript": "There's a pressure upon us to conform to the culture that we live in. There needs to be a greater pressure upon us from the Word of God to shape us into the image that God desires for us to be. Let's go in our Bibles to Mark's gospel, chapter 9 this morning. Mark chapter 9. And we're gonna look at a passage of scripture that's uh referred to as the transfiguration. And we're gonna focus really only on one small aspect of this storyline. Um this passage is intriguing because it is it's highly theological. Um the word theology is a compound Greek word. It comes from the word theos, which is a reference to God, and the word logos, word or study, and it's a reference to the the highest of all sciences, the the study of God himself. And of course, it's within the pages of God's word that we are able to discover God himself. And this passage of scripture is gonna draw our attention to really one of the highest, the loftiest of biblical concepts. And so we're gonna read through a portion of this. We'll start in verse one, and I'll note right away to you what that theological concept is. Look at at verse one. And he, Jesus, said to them, the twelve, assuredly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see, listen, the kingdom of God present with power. So this passage, what we're about to read is going to teach us something about the theological concept of the kingdom of God and its present power. So that's what this story is about. So buckle your seatbelt and get ready, because what we're gonna learn is we're gonna learn about God's kingdom and its present power. Now here's what happens. Six days later, verse two, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves, and he was what's that next word? Four people saw it. It's awesome. It's in verse two at the end, and he was transfigured before them. And then he then what Mark does is he describes what he meant by him being transfigured before them. Verse 3 says, His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launder on earth can whiten them. And then he says, and Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus, and Peter answered and said to him, said to Jesus, Rabbi, it's good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah. And one of my favorite statements, because he did not know what to say, because he was afraid. Hear him. Suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves, and then they came down the mountain. So we have this event where Jesus takes three of his disciples up the mountain and he's transfigured before them. And Mark leads into this by explaining that the purpose of this story is to reveal to us something about the kingdom of God. Now, the kingdom of God, as I mentioned, is a huge theological concept. It's it's the idea of the kingdom that Jesus brings with him. So when Jesus came, Jesus brought the kingdom with him. When Jesus comes, Jesus brings the kingdom with him. And this is something that would be very clearly understood in the in the mind of the Jewish people. They had for the past several hundred years had been occupied one time after another by various kingdoms, right? They'd been overthrown. They knew in their history, they knew when the Assyrians came, they knew what kingdom the Assyrians brought with them. It was a kingdom of violent destruction. They knew what kingdom the Babylonians brought with them when the cat when the Babylonians came. It was a it was a kingdom of replacement. They they took them from Israel and they they deported them into the various areas within the Babylonian Empire. They knew what the kingdom of Greece had brought with them. And they knew that that Hellenistic thinking that that brought with them began to infiltrate it its way into the thinking of the people. And they certainly knew what the Roman kingdom brought with it. When the Roman soldiers with their with the, you know, the short guys with their short swords and their short skirts showed up in Israel. And they brought the kingdom with them. And what they did is they began to plant little replica cities of Rome all over the place. Those of you that have been to Israel, so much of what we visit when we are in Israel is the remain of the Roman occupation of the land, what they brought with them. You go to Caesarea Maritime, and you stand there at Caesarea Maritime, you stand in the theater, and then you walk over, you see the Circus Maximus, you see the area where the palace would have been you, and you you walk, they're the remains of it. And the Roman cities would be planted throughout Israel. They when the king came, the king brought a kingdom with him. Does that make sense? So when King Jesus came, King Jesus brings a kingdom with him. And the kingdom is something that is both a future hope and it's also a present reality. The idea of being a future hope is the Bible tells us Jesus is coming back. It's one of the great themes of scripture. It's the anticipation and the expectation of the child of God that he's coming. You remember in Acts chapter 1 when Jesus is with his disciples on the Mount of Olives and Jesus is giving the final instruction to them. And they look at him and they say, Jesus, will you at this time set up your kingdom? They're anticipating, they're saying we want what the prophets had prophesied, what they told us was coming. Will you set this up now, Jesus? And Jesus says, it's not time for you to know. It's not yours to know the times or seasons. He says, but you will receive power when the Spirit comes upon you, and you'll be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judeus, Samaria, and the ends of the earth. In other words, my king, my future kingdoms, not right now, but get busy. And then they watched as he ascended up into the clouds. And they stood staring up into the clouds as if they were anticipating him coming right back. And angelic messengers had to come and say, Why are you staring up in the clouds? Get to what God has called you. There's an anticipation, an expectation of his coming. Jesus said that when he comes, he'll come with the clouds and with great glory. Jude said that he would come with tens of thousands of his saints. The psalmist says that when he comes, he will make his enemies his footstool. The Daniel gives this depiction. And how the kingdom of God represented by this stone will strike this image and its feet, and this image will crumble and turn to powder and blow away. Human governments will be no more. And in place, this stone will begin to grow into a mountain, and it will cover the whole earth, and the kingdom of God will have come. The prophets talked about the glories of this kingdom, and they talked about how it'll be a time of peace where the lion and the lamb would lay down together. Like right now, dude, can lion and lamb lay down together? It's a great deal for the lion. Not a super good deal for the lamb. Right? But there's this peace, and then righteousness. The kingdom of God, it's a future hope. But listen, the kingdom of God is also a present reality. Jesus was asked at one point about the timing of setting up his kingdom. And he said, the kingdom of God does not come with observation. He said, but the kingdom of God is with you, or the kingdom of God is in you, or the kingdom of God is among you. He's saying, right now we can experience the kingdom of God. And the kingdom of God is experienced when a person surrenders to the king. The Bible tells us what happens when you met Christ, when you give your life to Jesus, the Bible tells us that you now become the temple of God. And then Jesus begins to do a transforming work in you, doesn't it? He begins to change you, begins to make you different. And then the Bible says you're also now the light of the world because you're released to take the kingdom of God with you as you go. So you you came to faith in Christ. You met him, he began to transform your life, and then you went home, and the kingdom of God came into your home. And the kingdom of God began to affect how you interacted with others within your home, with your spouse, with your children, with your siblings, with your parents. The kingdom of God then began to affect how you went throughout the community. And it changed. It changed how you behaved at work. It changed how you behaved in your social activities. The kingdom of God went, you were the light of the world. The kingdom of God is among us. And the kingdom of God is transforming us. When when we kingdom, he brings with it a totally different value system, doesn't he? Have you noticed? I don't know, I don't live here, but have you noticed are the values of Northern Virginia different than the values of the kingdom of God? Today, I don't live here. I don't know. I live in Vero Beach, Florida. We've noticed it there. But uh there's different values, aren't there? And Jesus brings in this new value system when you start following him. I don't know if this is a true story. So just quick secret, don't tell Gary, I told you this, but a lot of pastor stories aren't true. But so I don't know if this is a true story or not, but I did, I I heard decades ago about an incident where some thieves broke into a department store in Manhattan, and uh and they broke in. It was back in the time where everything wasn't digitized, and so all the pricing was done manually. So you look at there's a there's an actual sticker with a price tag on every item within the store. And these thieves broke in and they didn't steal anything. What they did is they changed the stickers, and so they took things of very little value and they put a high price on them, and then they put took things of very high value and they put a small price tag on them. Well, the store opens, the customers come in, somebody walks up, there's a pair of socks for 400 bucks, and they think, I'm not doing that, but I like the fur coat. I don't know if you're allowed to wear those, but but the I like the fur coat for a dollar and a quarter. You get the idea, the the the economy had been messed up, and this store had to shut down commerce for the day, and they had to go through and they had to reprice everything because the value system had been broken. Listen, that's exactly what Jesus does. The value system of the world that we live in is broken, and we meet Jesus and we and we look at, we we listen to his teachings, and we realize, oh my goodness, there were things that I thought were so valuable that just really aren't that important to God. And there were things that I didn't think were valuable at all at all, and oh my goodness, these are key values in God's kingdom. He brings his kingdom with them. We learn how to behave by watching Jesus behave, don't we? So we we look like how does Jesus treat sinners? How does Jesus treat the repentant? How does Jesus treat the obstinate? And we learn how to behave. We our view of God. There seems to be something in human nature, God recognizes it. There seems to be something in human nature where we are bent on shaping God into our image. We're bent on doing it. We we take experience and we take emotion and we take imagination and we want to reshape God. And God knows that. So he gives Moses uh a uh stone with some etchings on it, and he says, Listen, it's not okay to shape me, right? No other gods and no graven images, because it's our it's our something in humanity. We want to shape God into our image. And God says, No, you're not to shape me. But listen, here's my son, and my son reveals to you exactly what I'm like. We see Jesus and we understand God. Jesus says, if you've seen me, you've seen the Father. So my point is Jesus comes, he brings the kingdom with him, and we understand what the kingdom is like. And this passage is designed to teach us something about that kingdom. What happens in the passage? Well, let's take a look at verse two. He says, now after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, led them up on a high mountain by themselves, and he was what? Transfigured. Transfigured. How many of you have used the word transfigured in a sentence this week? Okay, check your text streams. This is this is a Bible word, isn't it? And it's it's actually a pretty uncommon Bible word. It's only used four times in the Bible. The word transfigured comes from the same word bank that you would pull out the word metamorphosis from or the word change from. This word transfigured means to be changed completely from the inside out. It we could illustrate it with the idea of a maggot becoming a fly, which we don't like. So how about a, what is it, a tadpool becoming a frog? A little less gross. How about caterpillar to butterfly? Are we good with that one? We like that, or 18-wheeler becomes optimus prime. So there's transformation that takes place. That's this term, okay? Jesus looked one way at the bottom of the hill, and Jesus looked a different way at the top. Isaiah prophetically would describe him at the bottom of the hill. Isaiah would say he has no former comliness that we should desire him. He's saying he looked like us. Paul used language like this. He says, Jesus, though he was equal with God, he didn't consider it robbery to be equal with God, made himself of no reputation. And he took on the form of a servant, and he came in the likeness of men, and he humbled himself. And so how they saw him at the bottom of the hill was in his humanity or in his humility. But then when he went up the hill, oh, he looked very different. He was transfigured before them. He was radiant. Peter described this event later, years later in in 2 Peter chapter 1, he talks about this event, and instead of the word transfigured, he uses the word majesty, and he uses the phrase excellent glory. He says, Oh my goodness, we saw Jesus in all his radiance and all of his beauty. And so this story, it's teaching us something about the present kingdom of God, and what it's teaching us is this concept of transformation. This con this concept of transfiguration. I mentioned the word transfigured is only used four times in the New Testament. Two of those times are once by Matthew, once by Mark, as they're describing this event. The other two times, let's discover them together. So let's go to Romans chapter 12 together. Romans chapter 12. Again, the purpose is to teach us something about the present kingdom of God. Romans chapter 12. And this text is a pretty well-known passage. If you don't know it, mark it, put it to memory. It will be very helpful for you. It starts with this exhortation that because God is merciful, we should offer ourselves to God. We should give ourselves to God as a sacrifice. And then it gives us this instruction in verse 2. Paul writes, do not be conformed. Do you notice that word? Do not be conformed to the world, but be, what's the next word? Transformed. That's our word. That's the word transfigured. Same word. Do not be conformed to the world, but be transformed. And then he tells us how. By the renewing of your mind. Now, what Paul does in order to help us understand the concept of being transformed, he sets it against this idea of being conformed. And the word conformed here is a word that means to change the shape of something by applying pressure to it. And we know that we can something's shape can be changed by applying pressure. I'm a grandparent now, and so we we now have a bunch of little people toys in our house again. They had been tucked away, they've been brought back out, thrown away, and Amazon has delivered a whole bunch of other stuff. And uh and one of the things that we have is Plato. All right, and you pop the lid of the play-doh, and there's this soft clay inside, and then you apply pressure to it, and you can change the shape of the play-doh. And with my artistic ability, I can make a ball or a worm and I'm out, right? So, but I apply pressure to the play-doh, and its shape changes. And I I I guess theoretically, the shape of anything could be changed if enough pressure were applied to it. And what Paul is saying is that the world that we live in, in your case, Leesburg or Northern Virginia, and the world that you live in is applying pressure upon you in an attempt to shape you, to shape your values, to shape your view of God, to shape. Shape your view of yourself, to shape your view of others, to determine what data points you should pull into an equation when you're seeking to make a decision. All those things press upon us by the world that we're living in. We are, there's an attempt for the world to shape us. And then Paul says, oh no. Don't be conformed to the world. Instead be transformed. And the transformation, he says, comes through the renewing of the mind and the renewing of the mind, of course, would come from the pages of God's word. And so essentially what Paul's saying is there's a pressure upon us to conform to the culture that we live in. There needs to be a greater pressure upon us from the word of God to shape us into the image that God desires for us to be in. The word of God will transform us. And so as I was walking, I started thinking of that passage in Hebrews chapter 4 where Paul talks about the word of God. And he says, the word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword, and it's able to pierce between the soul and the spirit and the bone and the marrow. Now, prior to being a pastor and Bible teacher, I used to be a butcher. So before I fed sheep, I ate them. And but one of the things that you notice is marrow, marrow is so tightly connected within the bone that it's almost impossible to get all the marrow separated from the bone. It's almost impossible. And it's so tightly connected. Also, in addition to having been a butcher, I also am a human being, and I'm a Christian. And I know that there is often such a close connection between soul and spirit. The soul would be my emotions, the soul would be my desires, the soul would be my will, and the spirit is the new part of me that interacts with God. And there are times in my life where I struggle so much to make a distinction between is this my emotion and my own desire, or is this something that God is trying to accomplish in my life, or God wants me to do? And Paul, and the writer of Hebrews says, Oh, Jim, listen, the word of God will help you make a distinction. As you take in God's word, you can make a distinction between emotion, will, desire, and the plans and the purposes of God. God's word has that transforming ability. So listen, the word of God has the ability to transform the child of God. We've got time for one more verse. Let's go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 3. 2 Corinthians chapter 3. And we're going to look at verse 18. And this is the fourth and final time that this word transfigured is used in the New Testament. And we'll pick up at verse 18. Paul says, but we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being what? Transformed. There's your word again. We found it. Are being transformed. Listen, into the same image from glory to glory, just as by what? The Spirit of God. So what are the agents that God uses to transform the child of God into the image of God? The agents are the Word of God and the Spirit of God. And those two work in unison. And she said, you know, so often when God speaks to me, it's corrective. Meaning I'm thinking a way that I shouldn't be thinking, and then God reminds me of something in his word, and it corrects my thinking. Now listen, the context of that was conflict and marriage. So I'm really happy to know that God is correcting my wife's thinking as it relates to our relationship. I was very happy to know that. And have you found that to be true in your relationship in your relationship with the Lord that you're thinking one way or you're behaving one way, and then suddenly just some truth from scripture comes to your mind. You're like, oh man, I'm actually not supposed to be acting like this, or I'm not supposed to be thinking like this. And God is correcting us. It's the Spirit of God. Now, sometimes what I found to be true is I will know what the Word of God says. God, your word tells me I'm supposed to do this, or your word tells me I'm not supposed to do this. And I know that. I'm just struggling. I don't have the strength to either do the thing that I'm supposed to do or not do the thing that I'm not supposed to do. Listen, it's not only the word of God that transforms us, but it's the Spirit of God that transforms us. God actually energizes us to be able to do the things that He's called us to do. That's the beauty of our relationship with God. You are the temple of the Spirit of God. God's Spirit lives within you, and the Spirit of God is able to enable you and I to do the things that God has called us to do. So back to our story real quick. Here we've got the disciples with Jesus, and Jesus grabs three of them, and he says, We're gonna go up this mountain because I want you to understand something about the present kingdom of God. And he walks up the mountain and they watch him transform. And we learn that that same transforming power will work in our lives through the word of God and through the Spirit of God. Because listen, as Jesus transforms you, and then you go out these doors back into your home and into the community, you're taking the kingdom of God with you. And aren't you glad that the Spirit of God was transforming a child of God into the image of God, and that individual is the one that brought you to come to saving faith in Jesus Christ. The kingdom of God furthered when you came to Christ. So let's do this. Let's stand together. And let's take a moment to pray. We like to see things blow up. We like to experience things of great power. But Lord, we know there is there's nothing more powerful than the work of your word and the work of your spirit. Your word has the power to produce faith in somebody that doesn't believe so they can be saved. Your word has the ability to feed us in a way to strengthen us spiritually so that we can overcome the struggles of our flesh. Your word has the power to unlock the mysteries of life and of eternity. And so we're so thankful for it. And we're just asking God that as Paul talked about the transforming work of the word and the spirit that you would do that work within us. Lord, we're desiring to become more like you. We're desiring our life to re to reflect you better. So we pray that you'd help us with that. And we thank you in Jesus' name. Amen.",
