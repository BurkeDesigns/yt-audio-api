  "transcript": "God will go to great lengths to rescue us. That is the heart of God. He's so patient here with Israel. Despite their continued idolatry and disobedience, he goes after them over and over again. Aren't you glad he does that with you and me? Let's go to 2 Kings 14, where we left off last week. And we will pick up in the middle of chapter 14. If you don't have a Bible, I'm sure you can pull it up on your phone. I'll be uh reading, and we're studying here from New King James, but you could probably follow along with just about any version, but I'll be reading from New King James. Let's have a word of prayer, and then we'll get right into our Bible study tonight. Father, it is good to be in your house, even as your word said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord. And it's just always good to come, especially in the middle of the week, and to just settle our hearts before you and to be refreshed in your presence, to worship you, to study your word together. I thank you for all those who are here and those who are watching online. We just want to commit our Bible study for your glory and for our edification. That you would strengthen us, that you would teach us, you would stretch us, Lord, encourage us, you know, where we need it most. And so just have your way with us tonight. We give you glory, praise, and honor in Jesus' name, everybody said. Amen. Well, we left off in the middle of chapter 14. Let me bring us up to speed and remind us of the context here. Uh, the book of first and second kings, uh, originally one book in the Hebrew Bible, and it really records for us a history of, just as it's named, the kings. There were various kings in the nation of Israel. But after Solomon was king, the nation became divided. There was basically civil war, and there was a division in the nation, where ten tribes formed the northern part of the nation known as Israel, and then two tribes of Israel uh formed the southern part of the nation known as Judah. They each had their own capital, and the north it was Samaria, and the south it was Jerusalem, and they each had their own king. So when we're reading here now through 2 Kings, it often goes back and forth between a king of the north and a king of the south, and uh we're chapter 14, where we left off last week, the king of the south is Amaziah. He's reigning there in Judah, in particular, the capital city of Jerusalem. And um, it says, uh, just to recap in verse three, it says, and he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like his father David. Now, King David was not his biological dad. This is many generations later, but it's his spiritual father. David set a high bar, even though he had his own sin, even though he had his own faults. Uh, he was a man after God's heart, because even though he sinned, he was quick to repent. And that's what God really wants of us is to be quick to repent and to stay close to him in that way. And so, even though David sinned and he had his faults, uh, he set the bar high for a good king, a righteous king. And uh Amaziah here um did what was right, but not quite as good as what David did. Um, he did everything that his father Joash had done. However, the high places were not taken away. Those are the places of idol worship, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. So he was a good king, but not a great king. There were some things he allowed. And in the course of Amaziah's reign, um, he kind of got all full of himself. He had some success, some military success. He defeats the Edomites. Now the Edomites were perennial enemies of the Israelites. The Edomites on a map today would be basically a little bit of Jordan, a little bit of Saudi Arabia, and Amaziah defeated them. Now, when he defeated them, he did a very um irresponsible thing. And 2 Kings doesn't tell us this, but 2nd Chronicles does. So just bear with me a minute, and I'm gonna read to you from 2 Chronicles chapter 25. This is what Amaziah did after he has victory over the Edomites. Those are a foreign people who worship foreign gods. Listen what he did. This is 2 Chronicles 25. This is verse uh uh 14. Now it was so after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, meaning the Edomite gods, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them. Okay, now now let's just pause and think about this. You just defeat a foreign army with the power and the assistance and the might of the Lord your God, and now instead of giving thanks to the Lord God Almighty, you're gonna start to worship the idols of the nation you just defeated. Does this make sense? Because those gods didn't help the people you just whooped. So why would you want to worship them? But this is what he does, and listen to the rest. This is 2 Chronicles 25, verse 15. Therefore, the anger of the Lord was aroused against Amaziah, and he, that's God, sent him a prophet who said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people which could not rescue their own people from your hands? That's a that's a logical question. So this guy um did what was right in the eyes of the Lord to a point, and then he did some very silly things, so very stupid things. And he starts to worship the gods of the people that he just defeated. And God was angry about this. And so God's gonna teach Amaziah a lesson. Now, here's how he teaches Amaziah a lesson. Amaziah now has this great victory over the Edomites, starts worshiping the gods of the Edomites, and thinks now I can take on just about anybody. So he decides he's gonna take on his brother to the north. The king to the north is named Jehoash. And so he basically says to Jehoash, come out and fight me. You know, let's meet in the, you know, behind the school, and we're gonna beat each other. I'm gonna beat you. And and Jehoash is like, okay, calm down, calm down, Amaziah. Um, you just had a great military victory over the Edomites. Why don't you quit while you're ahead? Okay, just quit while you're ahead. Just relax, chill, sit out. And Amazia is like, no, I'm I'm on a I'm on a winning curve here, and uh I'm gonna beat you up. And so Jehoash is like, okay, all right, let's fight. And Jehoash brings out a much uh inferior army compared to Amaziah, with a lot less soldiers, and he beats Amaziah. And why is that? It's because God was trying to teach Amaziah to be humble about this. That pride went to Amaziah's head, and he just started thinking he could indiscriminately take on whoever he wanted, and he didn't give glory and praise to God because he's worshiping the gods of the people he defeated, and so God's gonna teach Amaziah a lesson. And Amaziah was soundly defeated, and Jehoash came to Jerusalem, destroyed the city, took away the silver and the gold in the city, and Amaziah was a broken, defeated man who had just been put in his place. And so that's where we left off last week, and it was one of the principles we gleaned from chapter 14 that God will humble us if we don't humble ourselves. And it's much better if we humble ourselves. It's much more painful when God has to do it. And Amaziah became uh humbled by the hand of God, because not only was his heart filled with pride, but he also is worshiping these gods of the nation that he just defeated. So now pick it up with me in verse 15. This is 2 Kings chapter 14, verse 15. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash, okay, that's the king to the north who defeated Amaziah. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash, which he did, his might, and how he fought with Amaziah, king of Judah. Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? That's what we have as first and second chronicles in our Bibles. And so Jehoash rested with his fathers, meaning he died and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And then Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his place. Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah. So now it's going back to this guy, lived 15 years after the death of Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. And now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lakish, but they sent after him to Lakish and killed him there. And then they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. And all the people of Judah took Azariah, also known as Uzziah, who was 16 years old and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. He built Elaf and restored it to Judah after the king rested with his father. So this is the end of these two particular kings. The king in the north, uh Jehoash, he dies, he's buried. Uh Amaziah, the king to the south, who got spanked by Jehoash. He dies, and uh he dies because he is killed. He's assassinated. There's this conspiracy against him, and he's buried, and Amaziah's son, Azariah, becomes king in his place, and he's 16 years old. You're king of one of the most powerful nations on the planet, if not the most. And you barely got your driver's license. You know what I mean? Wow, what an opportunity for a teenager to like be in control of a whole country. And so here he is, Azariah. Now again, as I said, his name is also known as Uzziah, U Z I. I A H. And in fact, he's better known as Uzziah throughout the scriptures. And we'll talk a little bit more about him later into chapter 15 because it starts to talk about his reign a little bit. So I'll save comments till then. But now it goes on to the son of Jehoash. So again, sorry for the confusion, but the Bible goes back and forth, north and south, north and south. So we're going back to the north here. In the 15th year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah. Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, okay, in the north, became king in Samaria and reigned 41 years. Okay, Samaria again is the capital city. It's not another country. It's the capital city of the northern kingdom. So now the next king here is Jeroboam in the north. But verse 24 is that same old song, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat. Jeroboam is the first king of the north, and he was very idolatrous, who made Israel sin. He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, which is the Dead Sea, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he had spoken through his servant Jonah, the son of Amitai. Does that name sound familiar to you? Yeah, that's the same Jonah who wrote the book that bears his name. That's the Jonah, the prophet, who ran from God when God said, I want you to go to Nineveh and declare the good news, so that those people can hear about me. And Jonah's like, uh-uh. Because Nineveh was a capital city of the Assyrians. The Assyrians were brutal people. The Assyrians were a ruthless people. You know what they were well known for? If they captured another foreign country, they would take the men, they would skin them alive, and they would use the skin of the men as wallpaper in their homes. That's the Assyrians. They would put hooks through your noses, and they would run a string through like fish. If you go fishing, you know how you put the string through the gills. The Assyrians would do it through the noses and then lead their captives that way all on a string. And so they were a ruthless people. And this is why Jonah's like, I don't want those people to get saved. Now let's be honest. There's some people you work with, you know, and you think to yourself, I don't want them to get saved. Because we need to have broken hearts for people. But there are some people probably on a list. I hope it's a short list. I'm not saying it's a good list. I'm just saying. Sometimes we're like, no way that person's gonna get saved, and I hope they never do. Don't want to see them in heaven. You know what I'm saying to you? Come on, be real with me. Don't look at me like I never thought that. This is Jonah. Jonah's like, I don't want to go preaching to those people. They are ruthless people. And God's like, they need they need me. You know, some of the people that we think we don't want to see in heaven are the very people that God says, go after them. I want them to be saved too. And so Jonah, this is the same Jonah, the son of Amitai, the prophet. Keep reading with me. He was in Gath Hefer 4, verse 26. For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel. Look at the compassion of the Lord. And the Lord did not say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash. Now, this is amazing on a couple of levels. Jeroboam, the son of Joash, is not a good guy, and yet God can still use a not good guy who's king to do his good work. That's why when people are like, you know, they get freaked out about whoever's in the white house. And I'm like, you know what? God can use whoever's in the white house to do his good work. You you can like him or not like him. And God still does his good work through human vessels. He used Jeroboam, a wicked king to accomplish his purposes to help save Israel. When Israel was so disobedient that they could have been wiped off the face of the earth, and God would have been just to do that, as he would be just to do that for any of us. Okay, God still his heart was, I want them to be saved. I want them to be rescued. I want them to come to me. And so this is another reminder to us. Uh this is the nature of the Lord. God's heart is for our salvation, not our condemnation. I mean, you know, this is this is Old Testament, but New Testament, 2 Peter 3 9, says that God wants none to perish but all to come to repentance. That's the heart of God. He wants all to be saved. He wants all to come to repentance and none to perish. Ezekiel 18 23, God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. I happened to be on Capitol Hill the day that Osama bin Laden was killed, and I stepped out of the capital, and somebody from ABC put a microphone in my face and said, Hey, the news is that Osama bin Laden had had has just been killed. And what's your reaction to that? And uh my reaction was Ezekiel 18 23. I said, God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Like, even the most vile person you could think of, God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, because he wants all to be saved. Now, not all will, but his heart is for our salvation, not our condemnation. And God will go to great lengths to rescue us, time and time and time again. Now, there will come a day of reckoning where there is no more time, either by virtue of the fact that we die and now we're accountable to the Lord, or he returns and we're accountable to him. But until that time, as long as we have breath, God is so gracious and merciful and long-suffering. He wants none to perish but all to come to repentance. That is the heart of God. He's so patient here with Israel. Despite their continued idolatry and disobedience, he goes after them over and over again. Aren't you glad he does that with you and me? He goes after us over and over and over again. Surely goodness and mercy, David said, will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me. The word follow in Hebrew is a military term, and it means will pursue me. God pursues us with his goodness and his mercy because of his love for us. And so, verse 28. Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, his might, how he made war, and how he recaptured for Israel from Damascus and Hamath, what had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? And so Jeroboam rested with his fathers, he died, the kings of Israel. And then Zechariah, his son, reigned in his place. Now Zechariah, that's not the same as the prophet. You know, there's same names for different people, obviously in the Bible. So this is a king following Jeroboam. This is not Zechariah the prophet. And then into chapter 15, we get into the reign of Azariah. Now again, this is Uzziah, the same. Azariah and Uzziah are the same people. And it tells us in chapter 15, verse 1, in the 27th year of Jeroboam, in the king of the north. So that's how they date things. They're like, okay, and the king of the north, when in his 27th year, a new king came on the throne in the south. And that king here is Azariah or Uzziah, the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, became king. He was 16 years old. Here we go. When he became king, and he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. Now, by the way, this is the second longest reign of any king in the south. So he had a very prosperous reign for 52 years. And it says that his mother's name was Jechaliah of Jerusalem. And look at verse 3, underline this, because this is a change. And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that is bro that his father Amaziah had done, except, so there's a but here. Except that the high places were not removed, the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. And then verse 5, and then the Lord struck the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death, and so he dwelt in an isolated house, and Jotham, the king's son, was over the royal house, judging the people of Israel. Okay, what is this all about? Why all of a sudden is he stricken with leprosy? Because he's a pretty good king. He does what was right in the eyes of the Lord. Uzziah was listed as uh a relatively good king. There were 19 kings in the north, 19 kings in the south, and there was one queen. Remember Athaliah who who rose to the throne because she killed all her grandsons after her son died, so that she could be uh queen for a day, like you know, murderous mammal, you know, just like I'm gonna kill all my grandsons, and I'm gonna be, you know, queen for a day. And uh she was queen a little bit longer than a day, but um, she just was murderous. So she was just this, you know, gangsta grandma, and just killing all our grandsons, so she could be king. So 19 kings of the north, 19 to the south, one queen, one wicked murderous mammal, and of the thirty-eight kings, there were only eight who were considered good. And of the eight, there was only one who didn't mar his testimony in some way. So Uzziah falls within the seven who were. Were good, but Martha's testimony, because he didn't purge Israel from all of their idolatry. And he does something that causes the Lord to judge him. And the way the Lord judges him there in verse 5 is to strike Uzziah with leprosy. Why did he strike him with leprosy? You can turn over to the right a couple of uh pages, go to uh 1 Chronicles and then 2nd Chronicles chapter chapter 26. I think this is worth reading, so that we understand what happened. You know, the wonderful thing about the Bible is the Bible is the best commentary on the Bible, and what 2 Kings doesn't tell us, 2 Chronicles does. And there's an incident that happens here in 2 Chronicles chapter 26 about Uzziah, that I will read, and so we get an idea. Why was he stricken with leprosy? God doesn't just indiscriminately strike somebody with leprosy, and leprosy was a death sentence back in that day. Uh leprosy today is not really a death sentence. There is a cocktail of drugs that um have been developed to combat the um the or the organism, uh the bacteria, the leprae. Uh today leprosy is called Hansen's disease, because uh Dr. H. A. Hansen, who discovered the causative organism and then um developed the concoction of drugs. It uh leprosy was not really curable until the 1980s for thousands of years, it was an incurable disease, and it was a slow uh process too. Um, sometimes today we we think of leprosy as like that flesh-eating bacteria. It wasn't wasn't quite like that. It would often attack the extremities, um, and so the bacteria would attack the cartilage of your nose, the cartilage of your ears, you would start to lose those things. It also desensitized someone. They they would lose feeling in their it attacked the nervous system. So you would lose feeling in your fingers, for example, and then people would would easily burn themselves or be get frostbitten because they couldn't uh discern pain in the tips of their fingers and their toes and that kind of a thing. But um, it was actually something that you didn't die of very quickly. It was a it was a slow, debilitating disease. And of course, we know that in biblical times, if you were uh diagnosed with leprosy, you were then secluded. You had to be quarantined uh because you know, it was infectious. It wasn't actually as highly infectious as people thought in the day, but nevertheless, it was an incurable disease, and uh it was a slow death sentence. So why was Uzziah stricken by the Lord in this way? Well, this is 2 Chronicles 26. Let me read uh verse starting at verse 16. This is Uzziah, when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord his God by entering the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. And so Azariah, or Uzzah, uh okay, now this is the priest. So Azariah, the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of the Lord, valiant men, and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, It is not for you, Uzziah to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the son of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed, you shall have no honor from the Lord God. So here's what he did. Uzziah, as king was a very successful king. The Bible talks about building projects, military conquests, uh, the economy was great under Uzziah. He was a popular king, and that popularity went to his head, and when it went to his head, he started acting as a priest, even though he was called only to be a king. A priest had to be a descendant of the line of Aaron, which was the Levitical line. Uzziah was of the tribe of Judah. He was a king, he was not a priest. He was not consecrated for that duty and that responsibility. So he rushes into the temple thinking he can perform the duties of a priest. He starts to, you know, offer the incense here, and he's getting ready to sacrifice, and he's acting like a priest, and the high priest goes in and says, You can't be doing this. This is not your role. This is not your calling. You were not consecrated as a priest. You need to get out of the temple. And Uzziah here becomes furious. It's verse 19. And then Uzziah became furious, and he had a censor in his hand to burn incense, and while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord beside the incense altar. And Azariah, the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there on his forehead he was leprous, and so they thrust him out of that place. Indeed, he also hurried to get out because the Lord had struck him. King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an isolated house because he was a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the Lord, and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land. Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah from first to last. The prophet Isaiah, the son of Amos wrote. And so Uzziah rested with his fathers, and he and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial, which belonged to the kings, for they said he is a leper. And then Jotham his son reigned in his place. And so you have here this king who does something that he shouldn't have done, acts in the role of a priest. Why? Because pride filled his heart. He was full of himself because of his success, and then God struck him with leprosy. The last seven years of his life he spends isolated. And his son Jotham really is kind of like a puppet king. He's judging, he's making decisions on behalf of his father until his father dies, and then Jotham becomes fully king himself. But this leads to a point here from chapter 15 for you note takers. It doesn't matter how well you start with what matters is how well you finish. Uzziah got off to a great start, but he did not finish well. And it is important for us to remember that. Some of you didn't get off to a great start in, you know, in the way you're following Christ. Like, you know, maybe you maybe you came to know Christ late in life. Uh maybe when you came to know Christ, you you weren't really walking with him. You know, you made a profession of faith, but you really weren't fully surrendered to him. Um got out of the blocks uh a little shaky. And so it doesn't really matter what kind of a start you got. What matters is that you finish well. Uzziah did not finish well. Now, Uzziah had for his benefit, various prophets who would speak into his life. It's interesting if you look at Isaiah, Isaiah chapter one, verse one says that Isaiah was called as the prophet during the reign of Uzziah. In Hosea 1 1, it says the prophet Hosea was called as a prophet during the reign of Uzziah. If you look at Amos 1-1, Amos was raised up as a prophet during the days of Uzziah, and Zechariah the prophet. All of these who have names named out uh books named after them, because they they wrote these books Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, Zechariah the prophet. They were all were prophets during the reign of Uzziah. So he had plenty of spiritual voices from the Lord speaking into his life, and yet this guy parades into the temple, acts like a priest, and suffers the consequences for it. He was even much more accountable, because he had the words of the prophets around him, challenging him. Now, as a side note, one of the interesting things about the reign of Uzziah was that the Bible records a severe earthquake. You know, we just had here on the news this eight, what did they say now, 8.8 uh on the Richter scale, this earthquake uh in the Pacific and you know, the tsunamis and and all this stuff. Um, there was a great earthquake in the days of Uzziah that the Bible records, and the year was roughly 760 BC. And the reason I bring this up is because the prophet Zechariah, who prophesied during the reign of Uzziah, says something in Zechariah chapter 14. You can either turn or just listen. Zechariah talks about the second coming of Christ, and he compares an earthquake that's gonna happen around the second coming of Christ to that of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah. So I'm just gonna read it just because there's gonna happen yet another earthquake in in Israel. I just hope not when I'm there uh with a tour group. But um, but listen to Zechariah 14. I'll read the first five verses. Behold, the day of the Lord is coming, and your spoil will be divided in your midst. For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem. That's Armageddon. The city shall be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished, half of the city shall go into captivity, but the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city. And then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as he fights in the day of battle. And in that day, his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives. This is what the Bible teaches. Jesus, when he comes again, will come back to the Mount of Olives, the very place from which he ascended into heaven. And the day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west, making a very large valley. Half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it. Toward the south. And then you shall flee through my mountain valley, for the mountains valley shall reach to Azal. Yes, you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, King of Judah. And then the Lord my God will come and all the saints with you. So Zechariah prophesies about an event that still has yet to happen. And it's interesting that this great earthquake that happens during the reign of King Uzziah gets linked to the second coming of Christ. When Jesus returns, there will be a great earthquake, and people will flee, like in the days of King Uzziah. So back here in 2 Kings, this is that king, uh Uzziah, you know, starts off well, doesn't finish well, um, has a lengthy popular reign. Remember also that Isaiah was a prophet during the reign of King Uzziah, and it was in the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah writes in chapter six, that I saw also the Lord, high and lifted up and seated on the throne, and the train of his robe filled the temple, and above him and around him flew seraphs with six wings, two wings they covered their face, and two wings they covered their feet, and two wings with they flew, and they uttered one to another. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty who was and is and is to come. So very similar to the scene in Revelation chapter four, by the way. Um so Isaiah was actually called by God and commissioned in the year that King Uzziah died. So interesting guy. I you know, I think there's um much to be said about Uzziah, but uh a tragic end. Last seven years of his life, he's just in quarantine because of his leprosy. Well, keep reading with me here in chapter 15. Now we get here at verse 8, and Kings is gonna hear talk about five different kings of Israel in the north, uh, and it's just a rapid succession. We're gonna see here these various kings, rapid succession. Um, they're gonna mention we're gonna see five kings here that are mentioned in rapid succession. Only one out of the five dies of natural causes. There is murder, conspiracies, assassinations. I mean, the whole northern kingdom is unraveling now rapidly at this point. And we're gonna see here that the northern kingdom is gonna get invaded by the Assyrian Empire. Now the Assyrians were a rival empire. Um a map, Assyria would cover much of the modern country of Syria, um, almost all of Iraq and a little bit of Iran. The Assyrian Empire was huge. They will become the dominant world force, world power, and they will come against the northern kingdom of Israel, and God allows it, because it's his way of getting the attention of the people he loves, and the Assyrians are gonna come now, but we're gonna see here that rapid fire, these different kings that are all messed up, and they start killing each other just so that somebody else can become king. So the the next king here to the north is Zechariah. Now again, this is a king. This is not the same as the prophet Zechariah. So in verse eight, it says, in the 38th year of Azariah, king of Judah in the south, Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel in the north in Samaria, but look, only six months. Okay, we just got through talking about Uzziah, he reigned 52 years. This guy reigned six months. Why? Because he's gonna get assassinated, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord as his fathers had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had made Israel sin. And then Shalom, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him and struck and killed him in front of the people, and he reigned in his place. Now that little part there about how he killed him in front of the people means he did this, you know, in in the wide open daylight. It's like it's like Shalom did what he thought was a favor for all the people. Like he didn't try to sneak around doing this, just like in front of everybody, he just kills this guy, he kills Zechariah, and and Shalom becomes king. And it says, now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, indeed, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. And this was the word of the Lord which he spoke to Jehu, saying, Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation, and so it was. And that means basically that Zechariah's assassination ends the dynasty of Jehu. Okay, so now Shalom kills him. So now Shalom is king. Shalom, the son of Jabesh became king in the 39th year of Uzziah, king of Judah, and he reigned a full month. Full 30 days in Samaria. For Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Turzah, came to Samaria, and struck Shalom, the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed him. And he reigned in his place. So Shalom, Shalom murders Zechariah, and then Shalom gets murdered. He gets assassinated. So it's a simple reminder, friends. Uh, number two on the list of chapter 15. You reap what you sow. You go around killing people, you're probably gonna get killed too. But the Bible talks about this. I mean, this is a principle that we have to understand. That's why I put in parentheses there, Galatians 6, 7 to 8, and Hosea 8, verse 7. You know, Galatians 6 talks about how God will not be mocked, whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap. And there in Hosea 8, 7, Hosea reminds us, you sow to the wind, you will reap the whirlwind. Like you sow to the wind, you're gonna get a tornado. Like you're gonna get what you sow. And it's important that we sow in righteousness so that we can reap in righteousness. Um, you act in a certain way, you behave in a certain way. Uh, you know, I mean, the world in its crazy cult-like way would say, you know, karma, karma. Well, it isn't karma we're talking about. We're just talking about the principle of reaping and sowing. And and the way that you live and the way you behave, it will it will come back to you in some way. So, whatever a man reaps that will he also, whatever man sows that shall he also reap. And so now on the throne is Menahem. Verse 15 says, Now the rest of the acts of Shalom and the conspiracy which he led, indeed, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. And then from Terzah, Menehem attacked Tipsah, all who were there and his territory, because they did not surrender, therefore he attacked it. All the women there who were with child, he ripped open. This guy is brutal. This guy is the worst of the murderers here. Well, in the 39th year of Azariah, king of Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadib became king over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat who had made Israel sin. And then verse 19, here come the Assyrians. Pool, P-U-L. Now, uh, in some of your uh Bibles, like mine, there is um there's a footnote to Pool, and you will see that his name is also Tiglath Pilazer. Tiglath Pylezer, uh actually Tiglath Pilezer III to be technical, and he is the king of Assyria. So here come the Assyrians. Puel, also known as Tig as uh Tiglath Pilezer, King of Assyria came against the land, and Menahem gave Pool a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his control. Now, what's he doing? He's he's basically saying, if I give you money, will you go away? And he pays him a thousand talents of silver. Now, a single talent was seventy-five pounds. This is a boatload of silver. So a thousand talents, you got seventy-five thousand pounds of silver. So I did the math because I was curious, like, what is but would this be worth in today's money? So I looked it up, and silver's going for like 38 bucks an ounce, and so the equivalent will be in today's dollars, 46 million dollars. So he pays the guy 46 million dollars to go away. And look, look where he gets the money. You gotta love this. Verse, verse uh uh, whatever the next one is. It's so verse 20. And Menahem, hey, I'm only getting older, and these numbers are getting smaller. And Menahem, Menahem exacted the money from Israel from all the very wealthy, from each man 50 shekels of silver to give to the king of Assyria. So look what he look what he does here. Bernie Sanders is not the first one. He's like, you know, the wealthy, they need to pay, they'll fail share. They need to pay their failshell. Take the money from them and give it. Like, so Menahem had him beat for you know a long time ago. Was gonna, we're gonna take it from the very wealthy, and and we're gonna give it to this guy. And so the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land. Yeah, okay, because he's been paid off. But for how long? Oh, this guy does come back. And he comes back with a vengeance. And it is a reminder to me. This is how it spoke to me. Number three, if you appease the enemy, he may retreat, but he will always return. And I capitalized it because I want to make it applicable to us. You know, there are many ways that the enemy will come against us, and we just can't negotiate with the enemy. We have to stand firm. We have to resist the devil and he will flee. Greater is he, the Lord in us than he that is in the world. Spiritual warfare is real. There is an enemy who hates you because you love your father, and he hates your father. And he will do everything he can to rip you off, to deceive you, to lie to you. He is a liar and the father of lies. He is a murderer. He wants to ruin your life, wreck your life, and take as many people to hell with him. That's his goal. And when we play games with the devil, and we think that we can just continue to live our lives the way we want, we're playing right into his hands. You you can pay him off for a time. You can make a deal with the devil for a time, but he will come back with a vengeance. He does every time. Because he's not satisfied. So for the moment, Tigloth Pileser is appeased. You've got 46 million dollars. Take the money and run. But he's gonna come back, and it'll be worse. It says, now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? So Menahem rested with his fathers, and then uh Pekahiah, his son, reigned in his place. In the 50th year of Azariah, king of Judah, Pekahiah, the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria and reigned two years, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had made Israel sin. And then Pikah, the son of Ramaliah, an officer of his, conspired against him and killed him in Samaria in the citadel of the king's house, along with Argob and Arih, and with him were fifty men of Gilead. He killed him and reigned in his place. Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, indeed, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel. And in the 50th second, the 52nd year of Azariah, or Uzziah, King of Judah, Pekah, the son of Ramaliah, became king over Israel in Samaria and reigned 20 years. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had made Israel sin. In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath Pileser, there's his name now spelled out fully. King of Assyria, oh, look at this. Came and took. So here he comes back. Now he takes these cities. Eon, Abel Beth, Makah, Janoah, Kadesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and he carried them captive to Assyria. And then Hashiah, the son of Alah, led a conspiracy against Pekah, the son of Ramaliah and struck and killed him. So he reigned in his place in the 20th year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. Now the rest of the acts of Pikah and all that he did indeed, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. So I'm gonna stop there because those were the kings of the north. The next king is the king of the south, and we'll we'll move there next week. But notice how this ends, and this still isn't the worst of it. Um but the Assyrians will come and they conquer these cities. They are not content. You know, Tiglath Pilazer is not content to just give me some money, I'll go away. Now he actually takes the people of Israel captive. He takes them to Assyria. He's ruthless, and the northern kingdom is dissolving now. And um, it will still get even worse. And the ultimate year is 723 BC, when the Assyrians come, besiege the north, and um, and for all intents and purposes, the ten tribes of Israel are then dispersed into Assyria, and Assyria becomes the dominant empire. We have more to say about it, but for tonight, let's pray and let's ask the Lord to teach us good lessons from these folks. Lord, we thank you for your word tonight, and we pray that you would teach us lessons from these various kings, what they did right, what they did wrong, that we would be mindful, that we would be aware in our own lives, Lord, especially, especially this part about Uzziah not finishing well. Lord, help us to finish well. May we run the race with perseverance, as Paul said. When he wrote, I have run the race, I have kept the faith, I have finished, and there is in store for me the crown of righteousness that the Lord the righteous judge will award me on that day, and not to me only, but to all who long for his appearing. Lord, we look forward to that day. We can stand in your presence. Know that we've been forgiven and redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, standing in his righteousness before you. We thank you, Lord, as our Father that you love us so much, and that you desire that we would finish well. So help us, help us, Father, by your Holy Spirit to strengthen and empower us. Doesn't matter particularly what kind of start we got, how early in life we came to know Christ, or late in life we came to know Christ. Our prayer, Lord, is that we would finish well, that we would keep the faith. We would stand in your presence on that glorious day and hear from you well done, good and faithful servant. So may we learn from these stories. And we thank you for your word tonight. Be with us as we leave this place. We give you the praise and the glory in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen.",
