  "transcript": "Hey everybody, Gary Hamrick here from Cornerstone Chapel, Leesburg, Virginia. And I have in the studio special friend, a guest that I'm gonna be interviewing today. Her name is Patty Height. She's got a rich story. You don't want to miss it. If you know anyone, or you yourself are a part of the LGBTQ community or gender dysphoria or the transgender movement, you want to hear her story. That's what we're gonna be talking about today on Cornerstone Connection. So Patty Height, welcome. Thank you so much, Pastor Gary. Always good to see you. You too. And you uh lead a ministry called Out of Egypt Ministries. Yes. Um I've known you now for a few years, and you have a rich testimony of God's amazing grace in your life. By the way, I need to tell everybody this is totally unscripted. We knew we were gonna have this conversation. I have no pre-prepared questions. You didn't get any pre-prepared core questions. And so we're just trusting the Holy Spirit to to guide this whole conversation. So let's start here. Um in the years that I've known you, I've heard bits and pieces of your story, and um there seems to be a common thread in your story as to what was missing that led you down this path of same sex attraction, same sex relationship. Tell us about that. Yes, it's really in a in a nutshell, I would say it's longing for love. And we all long for love. Yeah, and most of us get it right from the beginning in our family, in our home with our parents, with our siblings, and that's not necessarily my story. I have um parents that they when they were alive, they were married for 67 years, so it's not that I came from divorce or anything like that, but there was some unhealthy um situations in my home uh when I was little that were damaging to my heart, to my brothers and sisters' heart, and for me, I didn't understand at the time, but I had a very tender heart. Yeah, and so while we all lived in the same home, my brother responded one day one way, my sister one way, and me one way, and the way I responded from that longing for love was like the song says, looking for love in all the wrong things. Yeah, yes. Where were you in the birth order? I'm the baby. You're the baby, and where did where did you go? 15 and 13 years younger than my brother and sister. So it was almost as if I was an only child living at home. Right. Because each one of us left the house when we were seventeen or eighteen years old. Is that right? Yes. And did each one of you leave at that age because of the unhealthy environment? Yes. Okay. And uh where did you grow up? Jamestown, New York, me and Lucille Ball. My wife has been asking me to take uh her to Jamestown to visit the Lucille Ball Museum. Oh my goodness, you have to go. Okay, I have to go. Um and so you were looking for love in all the wrong places. What was missing in your family that you felt so unloved? Touch. Yeah, the right type of touch. Yeah. Um, my mother didn't really hold me or give me that motherly uh intimacy and nurturing that I needed. Yeah. And I wasn't touched the right way in other ways in in my home. And so I my body was um I'll just say my body was being touched inappropriately, and then I picked at my body and injured myself. Okay, and so my body was um being used by others inappropriately, and I was damaging my own body with the things that I was doing to it to mask the pain that was on the inside. So you were into self-harm too. My self-harm started at five years old. Five years old. Five years old. Yeah. What was going through your mind and heart? Like what were you feeling that you I mean, besides to say I didn't feel loved, like why why does someone harm themselves like that? Because I think for me it was I wanted to feel a different type of pain than the pain I was feeling emotionally. Okay. And I could control the pain when I brought the pain on myself. And I just want to warn parents or anyone that's listening right now. I'm gonna describe a couple of things, and so if this might trigger you, yeah, that's go ahead and turn this off uh right now and pray and see if the Lord wants you to come back and listen or fast forward to maybe a minute from now. But I injured myself by picking at myself, and then I would get a knife to make wounds, and then I would pick the scab off the wounds, and when that pain wasn't sufficient, then I would pour water on it, and when that pain wasn't sufficient, I would get rubbing alcohol and pour that on it because there was an instant from the pain, there was an instant that feels better than all the other pain that I'm feeling. It was very, very hard, Pastor Gary. And were your parents noticing this? Did they try to get you help? They noticed it and they just kept saying, Stop it, stop it, stop it, and I couldn't stop it. And my parents didn't know what to do with that. And you know, there was that, there was the gender confusion that I had. I thought that I was a boy, and so I would tell them, Why do you keep you know, and this is way before preferred pronouns. I was born in 1966. Okay, all right. You know, so we'll say the early 70s. But I am a boy, you know. Why can't I go spend the night at my best friend Johnny's house? Well, because he's a boy and you're a girl, and it got so bad that when I was eight years old in 1974, my mother took me to our, you know, primary care doctor and said, My daughter thinks she's a boy, what should we do? And he just nonchalantly said, Don't worry about it, she'll grow out of it on the other side of puberty. Okay. And many children do, as long as there's no affirmation, especially for mom and dad. Exactly. But that's not my story because of all the other things that were going on. I remember, I was just thinking in my head, I can see myself as that little toe head little girl looking at other people, other adults longing, like, could you be my mom? Would you be my dad? I remember when people would knock on the door because people knocked on doors back then when you know the paper boy was collecting his money or the guy was dropping off the milk. Wow, I sound ancient. But I would hear someone knocking on the door, and I would think, maybe that's my real parents coming to pick me up. And I'm not adopted. You were just that detached emotionally from your parents that you that you started having these kind of thoughts. Um, and so let's fast forward a little bit. You you go through puberty. Are you still having this desire of like identifying as a boy? Are you dressing that way? Yes, one hundred percent. And so I don't I don't know when I entered into puberty because there's a lot of memories that I I don't have, so I don't know when as a girl my cycle started. I'm thinking maybe it was around eleven or twelve, but I'm not sure. And my when I would go visit the doctor, they're like, how can you not know? Yeah, I'm like, I'm sorry, but I don't. And so uh again, warning parents, right? Um, so when other little girls were, you know, they'd get a training bra and they'd put tissues in their bra to make them look more womanly, I would get a pair of socks and put them in my underwear to make me look more like a boy. And it wasn't just the visual, I didn't just want to look like a boy. I liked the feeling of what it felt like to have something there pressing on my body in that area, and that's gender, that's part of what would be described as gender dysphoria. Right. And so as I got older, in my fantasy world, you know, as an adult in my fantasy world in my mind, that would be I could actually visualize it on myself and feel it on myself, and that is how my fantasies would would go forth. What a hard way to live. Yeah. How unsatisfying, always longing for something that you can never get, even and I knew with uh uh reassignment surgery, we'll call it. Yeah, that even if I went and had surgery for them to create a genitalia area area that would be considered male, I knew that it wouldn't be real and it wouldn't give me the sensation for that that I longed for deep inside of my body. If you had been born closer to today's time, you would have probably gone forward with hormone blockers and surgery. So you were you were deeply entrenched in all of this. Your identity was completely confused. Yes, yes, and I was so alone. I didn't talk to my parents about anything. My brother and sister were so much older and out of the home. I didn't really have any friends. I mean, my guy friends that I hung out with when I was little, yeah, didn't you know, as I got older, didn't want to hang out with me anymore. I had no idea what it was like to hang out with girls, and so um I got kicked off the softball team at school, you know, I scholar, you know, probable scholarships, and then I got caught selling drugs, and so I didn't want to stop playing sports, so then I moved to playing softball at night with adult women, and so I just was at parties with 20 and 30 year old women and men, and they became my friends, quote unquote friends, right at 14, 15, 16 years old. So I felt lonely there too. I always felt out of place. So explain to me for for those who suffer from gender identity. Confusion. Um and they've they've actually relabeled it now as gender dysphoria, but it used to be in the statistic manual of diagnosis, an actual treatable mental illness, but now today in our culture we've so normalized it and we're doing a disservice and a harm to a lot of people who are in that confusion. They don't understand God's beautiful design of who they are, and they're missing that identity and that that we can find in Christ. And so um I'm gonna get ahead of myself if I don't if I don't uh uh just kind of pace this a little slower. You you are so you're you're you've got confusion about your your gender and your whole identity, and um there's been self-harm in your past, and there's been trauma in your family of origin, you bring all this. Now you're now you're around people who are not going to steer you in the right direction, they're going to encourage you in this direction. So you then get into at the same time that you're having confusion about your own sexuality and biology. Um you then migrate into romantic feelings and you start having same sex attraction. Maybe you've had it for years at this point when you were um already a teenager playing softball. How did that progress for you? It I knew in my heart, even though you know we weren't Christians in my home. We went to church on Christmas and Easter, but we weren't Christians in any way, shape, or matter. Um, but even in my heart instinctively, I knew girls liking girls was wrong. At that point, I knew I was female and there was nothing I could do to change it. Okay. And yet the the desire and the attraction toward women, girls my age was very strong, you know, girls in the neighborhood and girls at school, and so I just tried to always just pushed it down, like this is wrong, don't do it. People already think you're strange, this will make you even weirder. And so I didn't date any guys in high school. I didn't date anybody in in high school, and then I left the home at 17 years old, moved to Florida where my older sister was living, started hanging out with her friends, which were 15 to 20 years older than me because that's how much older she was. And um, at this one party, uh a guy came up and started talking with me, and he actually engaged in conversation with me in a way that nobody else had before. At the parties I went to when I was in New York, the the interaction between the men there were I have cocaine and you have a young body that I would like. Right, let's make an exchange. Right. And so I would think that I was the one in control. Right. That's just more sexual abuse, Pastor Gary. I was a child and they weren't they knew better. Yeah. And so at this party, when this man saw me and engaged and talked with me, I'm like, wow, he sees me and he's not expecting anything from me. So when he asked me out on a date, I said yes, even though I wasn't attracted to him, but I was attracted to the fact that he saw me. And so I went out on a date with him and getting, you know, to know him, asking questions. He had just told me that he'd been released from prison. And so, you know, that should have made me take a step back, but those were the type of people that I was uh around, not necessarily people from prison, but it it sh instantly shocked me. But then it's like, well, yeah, can't be a little bit more than a little bit. Well, he's accepting you and he's you know, he's showing you attention, and so that's that's that's meeting uh yeah, uh a need that you're ha wanted to be loved. Yeah, Pastor Gary. Yeah. And so I would have taken it from one someone that I was attracted to or not. I just wanted to be loved. Yeah. And so we continued to date, and I'm like, wow, this this might actually quote unquote cure me. Maybe I won't have to live with same sex attraction. Maybe I won't have to live with gender confusion. Yeah. And so just shy of a year later, we ended up getting married. And I really hoped that this would be the again the cure, so to speak, that that I was longing for, and it it wasn't because he started to physically abuse me once we got married. Yeah. And so now I heard verbal abuse in my home where my father believed belittled my mother constantly, and then I experienced sexual abuse, and now I'm experiencing physical abuse, all from men. And so I just is like, you know what, this is this is ridiculous, and I built this lie in my heart that all men are bad, all men hurt you, I hate men, I'm gonna become one. And how old are you now at this point? Uh I was in my twenties. Okay. Now at this point, okay. And so, but but hear that listener. Yeah, I hated men, and I wanted to be with talk about conflicts in someone's heart. Right. And so uh I, you know, had already had those that confusion within me, but now in my twenties, part of it is I want to be a man, I want to be strong, I want to be in control, and I don't want any man to ever look at me as a woman and hurt me again. So I'm gonna build up my armor in the way I present myself and the way I dress, and I mean, I even wore men's cologne. It was everything underwear, outer wear, everything on me was from the men's department, and that m was my wall or sense of protection because I felt very uh vulnerable as a woman. So is that is this a common thread for a lot of people who are trapped in the whole not only gender confusion, but in the same sex attraction. What's the root of that typically? It's not necessarily one thing. Well, I would say the cornerstone. So uh the enemy of our souls, the devil, Satan tries to mimic the Lord and all the things of the Lord. So we know in Christ, it tells us in First Peter chapter two that Christ is our cornerstone. Yeah, and we are living stones being built up a spiritual house unto the Lord. Christ is our cornerstone. Everything is built on that. Yeah. The enemy sees those people who've experienced things like me, and he knows that for for us, the cornerstone that everything else was built on was rejection, whether perceived rejection or real rejection. And when you experience sexual abuse, divorce, um death, you know, you could have a parent that dies, that would be perceived rejection. There's all types of ways children or young people receive rejection, again, either real or perceived rejection, and then everything else is built up on that. So if you if you see this big funnel of commonalities that people have and they're throwing all these different things in, yeah, when it funnels down, it funnels down to that one thing, rejection. Wow. And and Satan counterfeits everything that God gives. And so he's he's counterfeiting everything at the whole at the same time, you're trying to find your identity. Who am I? Who am I attracted to? All of this. Um beauty is that in the rejection, the one who gives us most acceptance. Again, he's counterfeiting everything. Is is the Lord. The Lord accepts us, that unconditional love. Each and every child, teenager or adult that is same-sex attracted, has gender confusion or dysphoria. The Lord is looking right into their heart and says, Come to me. Yeah. I know you're weary. Yeah. I know you're heavy laden. Come to me. I will give you rest. There is no rest in that life, Pastor Gary. There's no rest, especially with gender, because you're always trying to be in a place like, am I passing? Am I passing as this gender that I'm uh uh telling people that I I am, I'm presenting myself in this gender. Am I passing today? Yeah. It is so exhausting. So you you you left your husband. I did. And then you started living out this lifestyle that was a lie, and but yet you're still trying to find this love in all the wrong places. You end up in a same-sex relationship. Talk about that a little bit because I I want to get to the the heart of your story, which is how Christ transformed you. But it's the better trans. That's the real transformation. That's the transformation. So, but tell us uh a little bit about how that progressed and and then what brought you to the place where God got a hold of your heart. Yeah, so you know, I dated multiple women, had some short-term relationships, and every time there was a breakup, you know, it's a ripping of the heart. Yeah. And because they're so emotionally dependent on each other, like to the nth degree. Yeah. Uh, but then I met a woman who both of us uh realized this was it, we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together. And so we built our life together until different circumstances in our lives, uh one of them being 9-11. We were both flight attendants for a major airline uh based in Newark, New Jersey. So 9-11 happened, and that was devastating for all of us, and then right after that, my only brother Larry um was diagnosed with lung cancer. And so it was it was just a lot of emotional difficult things going on. And then my brother uh told me at one point that his neighbor Bruce Nordwall shared the gospel with them and he believes in Jesus now. And I was so excited for him. Oh, you were so your reaction wasn't off, you know, you weren't like no, for because I I was face to face when I went to visit him, and when he told me, he's like, Patty, I have something so now this man was just his hair was falling out in clumps from the chemo, the cancer was all through his body now, and yet he was so excited, and he's like, I gotta tell you something. I'm like, Are you in remission? He's like, No, Bruce is. And telling me about these things called the gospels and they talk about Jesus and Patty, I believe now. And he he was lit up and it wasn't from the chemo. Yeah. So I saw I I saw the change in my brother. And so I wanted I I wanted to be different than I was. And so um I was excited for him while at the same time wondering if he was gonna be like the Christians that I saw at Pride Parades telling me that you know God hates facts. Right, yeah. And so um, but he didn't, but then uh as I was holding his hand, he passed away into eternity, and that's when I realized death is real between nine eleven and all the death there that I smelled every day when I was home because I smelled those burning all the stuff that was burning for weeks and months, and then my brother died right in front of me. Death became real for the first time, and I knew eventually it was coming for me, and I was scared. Yeah. And so I just had this very deep question in my heart that I wanted to talk to my girlfriend who was my best friend, who was the only person I trusted, yeah, who'd never hurt me like all the other people in my life. Yeah, but I was concerned that this conversation would make her think that I didn't want to be with her. But as God would have it, he did it for me. Yeah. I woke up one morning, I rolled over and looked at her and just said, Babe, do you ever think the way we're living is wrong? And I was shocked that those words came out of my mouth, and I was shocked at the way she looked at me think because it was she she looked at me in a way that I'd never seen her look like she looked deep into my soul. Okay. And I thought it I thought that I'd ruined everything. I'm like, oh goodness, I'm gonna lose her now too. But her response blew me away because she was it she looked right at me, Pastor Gary and said, I can't believe you just asked me that. I was literally just getting ready to ask you the same thing. Wow. That is the power of the Holy Spirit. Yeah. That is the Holy Spirit who leads us and guides us in all truth. And the truth is that Jesus says, Come to me. Yeah, I love you. Yeah. And so we are shocked, not a typical morning conversation. But let me back up and to clarify because you're like, Oh, I don't want to lose her because you still had this deep desire for someone to love you, accept you, but yet God needed you to lose her. Yes. But that process does not necessarily come instantaneously. Right. Because it's it's like a s like experiencing a slow death. You're having to die to the old self. I mean, all of us as Christians are dying to self daily, right? But you're you're stepping into a walk with Christ and dying to self. That's painful. Well, I lost her as a lover, but I gained her as a sister. There you go. Because we both ended up getting saved the same day at Calvary Chapel in Oldridge, New Jersey with uh Pastor Lloyd Pulley. So that day, January 19th, 2003, we walked in as lovers and we left as sisters in Christ, never to be with each other again. Yeah, not even holding hands. And it's not like we were upset by that. We got home that day in the home we owned together and lived in together, and we were excited. It was as if that life we had before had never happened. We really became new cr creations in Christ Jesus. The old passed away and everything became new, and we were both excited to read the Bible and grow in the Lord, and so we I eventually moved out of the home, but we remained good friends for a long time until like maybe seven years, six, seven years later, and the Lord showed me that we were still emotionally dependent on each other. So we had to again be obedient. I remember going over to her house, it used to be our house and telling her that the Lord has called me to remove myself completely from your life. We both wept. Like I cried so hard I had capillaries or whatever you call them break out on my face. Probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. Yeah. Because I was loving her the right way now. Yeah. I didn't know I was still emotionally dependent. But the Lord did, and he wanted to do a work there. And so we left that thinking that that was how it was gonna be forever. But a few years later, the Lord brought us back together. He's like in my language, he's like, You girls are good now. And so we have a healthy right in a godly way. And so we're very good friends now. And she's she's a missionary. Yeah, she is. She just got back from a missionary trip that um I can't say what she does because she goes into very dangerous countries, but she is uh she's we'll just say she's delivering the word of God to people who have been longing and waiting for it for for a number of years. What a what a great story of redemption. Okay, we're not done yet. So if you all are still watching, um don't miss this this last part. You you walked into uh Lloyd's a good friend of both of ours. I've known Lloyd Pulley for years. You walk into his church. So as a pastor and and others who might be watching who are Christians and they go to church regularly. I've said this from the pulpit. We have not in years past done a very good job of reaching people who have same-sex attraction or tr uh gender identity confusion because a lot of times, maybe I don't know, maybe a lot, some many times. W we we tend to talk about the sin, but we don't often know how to draw people to Jesus because we're more about this is wrong and stop doing it. But you found something when you walked into that church that drew you to the Lord instead of repelling you, what was that? Well, remember how I explained the glow on my brother. Yeah, I saw that with hundreds of people when I walked into Calvary Chapel Old Bridge. Yeah, it's like they didn't overwelcome me, you know, in a weird way or underwelcome me, like, oh no, you know, the the gays are here. Right. Um, they were just as welcoming and inviting and full of joy as is everybody else around me. And so when Pastor Lloyd was sharing, he spoke truth out of God's word. And I received that truth, and so uh I just was going up to whoever I could find that had a name badge on, and I'd you know, after a few weeks, and I'm like, how do I become a member here? And they're like, Well, you just you just come and and and make this your home church, but then years later, Pastor Lloyd told me he was walking by an office where his, you know, some of his associate pastors were and staff members, and they were saying, So what do we do with those two lesbian women? You know, we'd already given our hearts to the Lord. But we came to church together, you know, and he's like, What are you guys saying? They're like, We don't know what what to do with those two girls. He's like, Are you kidding me? He's like, they gave their hearts to the Lord, either it was r a real conversion, and they gave their hearts to the Lord and give the Holy Spirit some time to to, you know, let them to work on them and sanctify them. And if it wasn't a real conversion, they're not gonna stay here, they're gonna leave. What are you worried about? Right. That was twenty-two years ago, you know, and and so because and I say that because just you know, these men, their heart was I think in in the right place, but they just didn't know what to do. So I'm so thankful for Lloyd's wisdom in that and his love through the years, him and his wife Karen. Yeah. And so for people who um have loved ones who are in a same-sex relationships or even have maybe just the attraction. What is your advice? How do you because I get this all the time from people who say, um, my adult daughter is in uh uh same-sex relationship or my adult son and they want to go on vacation with us, and I don't know if I should allow the partner to come because I don't want to condone it, but at the same time I don't want to reject my son because or my daughter because I want them to know the love of Jesus. There's this constant confusion of how do we stand for truth, but also be grace gracious to you know, reach people and to help them understand what the truth is so that they can really be free. What what's your advice to them? Right. Well, well, don't let their journey affect your journey with with the Lord, let who you are point to who he is. Yeah, and if we want to uh, you know, use ourselves uh for ministry to point to Jesus, let our love for people point to the Lord's love, then you have to have them in your life. Yeah. You know, the uh Paul says I can't remember which which epistle, but he's like, Look, don't associate with I think one of the Corinthians, don't associate with Christians who are in sexual sin, but you can't remove yourself from the life of people who don't know Jesus that are in sexual sin because they're still dead in their sin and and they're living their life literally the only way they know how. And so I for me, my belief, my heart is yes, include your children's partners in your life, bring them over to the house for the you know, barbecue or for dinner, you know, let them see, you know, all the the placards on your walls, you know. Our house is gonna serve the Lord and you pray and you have family game night afterwards, and let them see the joy and experience a home filled with the Holy Spirit. Yeah. Now, if they're from out of town and they want to come visit, say, of course we would love to have you come visit. I will give you the address or the the number to all the local hotels or the beds and breakfasts in the areas. Right. And if you guys can't afford it, we'll help you out with with that. We'll pay for two of the four nights that you're here. But we want to have as much time with you as possible. And then I take it even a step further and say, find out what your child's partner's favorite dessert is, and make sure you have that at the home. Because your child is telling their partner, Oh, my parents are Christian, they're over the top, they're so they might not say legalistic because that's Christianese, but you know, there's This and that and the other, and they drive me nuts, and and and they made me go to church and all this stuff. And so your your child's partner is has this preconceived idea of who your parents are. But when they come to your house and spend time with you and see the love and the joy that you have, they're drawn to that. But I can hear somebody out there watching this saying, but Patty, if we do all that, then our son or our daughter is going to think that we're okay with this because we're just very nonchalant, like, yeah, let's play games together, let's have dinner together. How do you keep the message strong and still show love? Well, if they question that you think that it's okay, then maybe you haven't shown them enough enough of your beliefs in Christ prior to that. So let's just say that's the situation. Yeah. It's okay to when they come over to say, I'm really happy that you're here, you know. Um, our our son, I'm sure has, you know, shared a little bit of who we are with you, but let me share. We are Bible believing Christians that love the Lord, and because we love the Lord and He loved us right where we were, yeah, because you know, we were dead in our sins, and then we became alive in Christ. And so we just want you to experience that same kind of love, but that's who we are. So I just want to let you know, you know, on their first visit, this is who we are. You are welcome, but you're gonna hear us talk about things with the Lord of the Lord. Yeah. So I want to just get it out front right now. Are you okay with that? Because I don't want it to be awkward for you, and I don't want it to be awkward for us. Yeah, that's good. Just lay it out. I mean, listen, we have to have a more fear of the Lord than we have of people. Yeah. And I think we're in a place now we're more afraid of people than we are of the Lord. Yeah. And so to those who might be watching who are in a similar place where you used to be. They are either confused about their gender or they're in same sex attraction. What do you say to them? But they but they want, but they are so dissatisfied that they're looking for something. And what do you say to them? Well I want to say to them personally is that Jesus loves you. Yeah, He sees right where you are, He's not mad at you. Yeah, He is not disappointed in you. He has a life for you that is better than anything you could have ever perceived. And in that, as you He's drawing you and wooing you to Himself, will you give him a chance? Yeah. And in that, I want to be 100% up front with you. As you come to the Lord, there are things that you are gonna have to lay down for Christ's sake. But it's things that he knows would bring you uh a better heart, more love. We all Paul says, the apostle Paul says, I die daily. Yeah, and so there's there's really not a difference between you know, Jew and Gentile or Jew and Greek and male and female. We all bring really personal things to the cross every day that we want to hold on to and not lay down. The first thing the Lord dealt with with me when I got saved had nothing to do with sexuality or gender, it had to do with my anger. That's the first thing the Lord worked on with me was my anger. And so as you bring your heart to the Lord, he might not even address the homosexuality or the you know transgender identity, he might address something different because he's gonna go to the part of your heart that he wants to reach first. That could have led to those other lives. Right. And so trust him wholeheartedly. Yeah, give him your heart in the full and trust him wholeheartedly because his plans for you are to do you good, yeah, not to harm you. I love it. So, Patty, um, why don't you just uh address the folks out there and tell them how can they get in touch with you, your your ministry out of Egypt ministries. I mean, people might have more questions or um they want to get in touch with you, or maybe they even want to support your ministry. Um, tell everybody how they can reach you. Well, great. It's out of Egypt Ministries.org. Please don't just type in out of Egypt that will bring you to some guy named Egypt who will try to sell you his workout program. It's out of Egypt Ministries dot org, and there is a prayer icon there. If you have someone that has uh LGBT identity that you want prayer for, please uh fill out that prayer request form for LGBT issues only, please. And then if you have other prayer requests, you can reach out to uh Cornerstone Chapel for for that. There are different videos there, there's videos for parents, there's videos for youth and young adults that could help you and to to dig more into uh my story or ways you can minister to uh you know, certain child again, children or or um neighbors and co-workers. There is a place that you can donate to the ministry if you like, but there's also a resource page that is very, very helpful. So you click on the you know, the three lines in the upper right hand corner of the website, and that will take you to resources, and there's resources on there for ministries that do counseling, there's resources of books and other websites because I don't want you just going to my website. There's other ministries like this that I think can be helpful for you that do counseling, but then there's also some resources that will help parents to understand uh the devastation and the demonic activity that happens with your children that watch anime. There's articles in there about how much sexual abuse happens with our children when they're online gaming, in particular Xbox. So there's just all kinds of information there that will be helpful that I can't always talk about because it's just too much information, and so it's listed there for you under resources that will help you because we don't want you to walk through this alone, whether you're someone that wants to minister to the LGBT community, or you're someone that has uh same-sex attraction or uh a gay or trans identity, and you want to have a relationship with God and you're not sure. Do I have to lay down my gay identity to have a relationship with God? Ask him. Turn to the Lord and ask him, trust God, start to pray and go to my website and some of the other websites that I have listed on there, and we will walk alongside you with this and through this. My guest today has been Patty Height out of Egypt Ministries. Patty, it's always good to hear your story and just how the Lord has transformed your life, um, made us new creatures in Christ, and you're just a living testimony of God's redeeming grace. May I say this, Pastor Mary? And I I want to look you in the eye and say this. It was a process, but I'm telling you from the depths of my heart that I no longer have same-sex attraction, and I no longer have gender confusion and the freedom I have in Christ, there's there's nothing that matches that, but the freedom to no longer have these deep embedded um desires and confusion within me, the freedom from that is second to the freedom, the feeling and the joy of the freedom that I have in Christ. And that can be your story too. Trust the Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Thank you, Patty. Thank you, Pastor Gary. God bless.",
