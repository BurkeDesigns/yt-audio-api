  "transcript": "If you just arrived arriving, I mentioned at the beginning of the service that I'm putting our study on 2 Kings on hold just because of in light of today's event. And if you have not been aware of the news, Charlie Kirk was assassinated today. And I said at the beginning of the service is deeply personal for me because Charlie was a friend. And I'm I'm kind of in shock, to be honest with you. I the tears will come, and maybe even before this service is over, but I'm just so in shock right now that to try to prep for 2 Kings just is not in me. So thank you for understanding. And then on your way there, I just want to talk briefly about my friendship with with Charlie. How many of you were here four years ago when Charlie was here at Cornerstone? Okay, so most of you. And really more and more and more, if you if you've listened to Charlie over the years, more and more and more, he just was talking about Jesus and just talking about the Lord. So I know I'm gonna see him again. I know where he is. But uh Charlie was here four years ago, and uh he and Erica and Terry and me were having dinner upstairs here at the church, and um I remember him sharing something. We he also asked me to gather a few pastors from the community together, and he wanted to talk to them before the event. So after we had dinner together, then down in our chapel, there was a uh a few uh pastors in the community, and I remember Charlie saying to us, in fact, one of the local pastors texted me tonight and said, Do you remember when Charlie said that what he does is the second most important thing? He said, What you as pastors do is the first and most important thing. And um that was really his heart was for the gospel, and um so turning point became a grassroots movement, especially among the younger generation for really the the um the the heart of America, but more and more he understood that the heart of America is really going to be changed when the hearts of individuals change because of the gospel. After he was here four years ago, then the next year he he flew Terry and me out to Phoenix, where he does these um different events at uh at a church in Phoenix, that's where they lived, and and the attended at church uh there in Phoenix and um Dream City Church, and so he had uh tearing me out there and he and he interviewed me at this event. Um, and uh, and then next week, uh like in ten days on Friday of next week, I was supposed to be with him at an event at World Outreach Church in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Uh the pastor, there's Alan Jackson, and I texted Alan as soon as this news broke, and I don't even know if that event is still gonna happen now, because it was you know, it was about ten different speakers, and I was just one of them, but Charlie was like the keynote speaker, and so I was gonna see him next week. And um, and so that's why this is deeply personal for me, and that's why I appreciate you understanding that um a sermon out of 2 Kings just is not where I'm at tonight. But I uh I was looking into Psalm 13, which is a psalm that I taught on a Sunday morning a couple months ago after the tragedy in Texas when those children were swept away by that uh flood. And so the Lord just drew me back to that chapter. And um as I said earlier, I I'm not gonna speak for very long. I don't have much in me to share. So I'm gonna speak for just a few minutes from this chapter, and then uh we're gonna sing a couple of closing songs and we're gonna call it a night. And we're gonna pray for again for Erica and for the girls. But so this is Psalm 13, and if you have a subtitle in your Bible, mine says Trust in the Salvation of the Lord. This is a Psalm of David. And he writes, How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? Consider and hear me, O Lord my God, enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, lest my enemies say, I have prevailed against him, lest those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved. But I have trusted in your mercy, my heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me. You know, he David goes from questioning God to worshiping God in just what six verses. And he starts out by asking these four different questions. And I think it's important for us to remember it, it's it's not wrong for us to question God. Not that we're questioning him, but we're asking the whys, and God can take our why questions. And when we have questions like this, you know, this is this is one of those moments we're like, why God? You know, I think about Erica as a young widow now and two little girls, and it's easy to be like, you know, why Lord? Why why you're sovereign? Why why did you allow this? And it's okay to ask the why questions. David asked four why questions at the beginning of this psalm. Habakkuk asked God a lot of why questions. Jeremiah asked God a lot of why questions. Remember, even Jesus on the cross. He says, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? In that moment when he took on the sins of the world, though he himself committed no sin. He became sin for us, and in him we might become the righteousness of God. And in this moment within the triune Godhead, there was this sense of aloneness that's difficult for us to even understand that Christ felt on the cross, and so he even asks why, he's actually quoting from Psalms when he does that. And so it's it's okay to ask the why questions. God can take our why questions. But we have to also remember at the same time, he's just not obligated to answer us. And that's when we just have to really lean into the Lord. You're gonna have a lot of why questions in your life. I've had a lot of why questions in my life. And when we don't really get answers to our satisfaction, we have to just lean into him and say, Lord, I just have to trust you because I don't I don't understand this. And things just don't make sense sometimes this side of heaven. It's okay to ask the why questions. And it's okay to recognize that there will be some things we don't have answers for. That's what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13. I think it's verse 12 when he when he said, Um, now I see but in a glass darkly, or like what he meant was like a foggy mirror. He says, now I know in part, but then when I'm with the Lord, I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. So he he recognized that there's some things that we will not understand this side of heaven. I know in part, like I don't get everything. But one day when I'm with the Lord, Paul writes, then I will understand fully, even as I'm fully known. And so we have to make allowances for the fact that we just will not get it. And when we don't get it, and we ask the Lord the why questions, we just have to constantly just okay, Lord, I'm just I'm trusting you in this moment because I don't I don't get this. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm sure that you've had those moments where you've wrestled with God about why something doesn't make sense in your life. And it is not a reflection on the Lord. We live in a world full filled with the why questions because we live in a very wicked and evil world. That's what happened today. That's what happened today. Some evil demoniac decided I don't like what this guy stands for. I don't like some of the things he says. And so that person thought the answer was just take him out. And um that is indicative of our evil world, and it's tragic. But because we live in a fallen world, filled with sin, we're gonna have times in our lives where there are these moments of God, this is evil, this is wicked, I don't understand, and constantly reminding ourselves. Ourselves, this is why Jesus came to rescue us from this kind of a world. This is why Jesus came to rescue us from this kind of world. Well, why hasn't he come back yet? Because he's wanting as many to get saved. He wants none to perish but all to come to repentance. His delay is for us. And so he is not slow in keeping his promises as some understand slowness. But he is patient, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance. And so we we lean into him. We trust him in these times. Now, David remarks about his enemy. You know, he says there in the middle of this verse, and he says, Lest my enemies say I have prevailed against him, verse 4. You know, he asks the Lord to help him because he doesn't want his enemy to think that he's gotten the upper hand. And, you know, in the moment, there are you know, people who think that they've gotten the upper hand, but it it never silences truth. Not that, not that Charlie Kirk was, you know, truth personified, but my point is just simply that when people do evil things to try to silence someone that they don't like, it's not like it will ever really silence them because killing someone doesn't change anything except accentuate the fact that there's evil in this world. And turning point will go on, and the message of turning point will go on. And um, but again, you know, I I don't want this to be a memorial service about Charlie Kirk as much as whenever we are burdened by the fact that we live in such an evil and sinful world. All we can do is put our trust and our hope in the Lord and put our confidence in him and lean into him at times like these. Because what I love about where David goes here is he ends up in this place of praising him. I mean singing to the Lord. That's why, that's why I said, okay, look, our hearts are heavy, but I still wanted to sing a couple worship songs, and we're still gonna sing two more on the way out. But the way he says here, but I have trusted in your mercy in verse 5. My heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me. I think what David does here is he moves from this place of woe is me to this place of wow, Lord, you've you've actually been good to me, and I I've just been too focused on the dark things, I've been too focused on the heavy things, I've been too focused on the mournful things of my life to really notice how bountifully you have dealt with me. And a lot of times it takes that pause for us to get that right perspective. You ever been in one of those moods where you just feel like woe is me, and then you stop long enough to go, wait a minute, let me count my blessings. Wait a minute, let me stop and just realize this and this and this. Thank you, Lord. And then we can move our hearts from this place of just being uh wondering the why questions to the place of, okay, Lord, you have dealt bountifully with me. You have been good to me. And so I want to focus on your goodness and I want to focus on your mercy. I want to focus on who you are, because my circumstances will change. Tomorrow's another day. And that's why Jesus says, don't give thought to tomorrow, for tomorrow has enough worries for itself. And we'll have to deal with tomorrow's stuff tomorrow. And so you deal with today's stuff today. And every day you give it to the Lord, and if it's a good day, you thank him. If it's a bad day, you give him your heart, and you empty all of that to the Lord, and then you say, Okay, Lord, help me to see just how much you have blessed me in the midst of all of this dark and grievous stuff. This is a this is a sad day. Sad day for me personally. I think it's a sad day for America. I think whenever a high profile person who has a message that, in my opinion, was very beneficial for the country, and then someone assassinates that person to try to silence them. I think that that's a very sad day for the whole country. You may not have liked some of the things that Charlie Kirk said. There were a couple things I disagree with him about. We got into a text war every once in a while. That's okay. We were still friends. But may the Lord help us as a country to continue to press on, to not shrink back. Friends, if you stand for Jesus and you stand for truth and you love America, that seems to be a deadly combination these days. And I mean that literally. Look at look at what's happened today. You love God and country. You stand for Jesus and America. People will hate you. And look, I don't, I don't want to make this about me, but I was thinking today, it was like, Lord, I'd rather have the prayers of the people than to not say what I'm about to say. Um I get my share of death threats. I'd rather have you praying for me than to just not mention it. And I'm not going to mention it again, except for today, because it's heavy on my heart. If you could just pray for my family. And I know you do, and I appreciate that. And it's, you know, Charlie knew, Charlie knew that he got death threats all the time, far more than I've ever gotten. And he still knew that day might come and it has. And it doesn't make it any easier, except I have deep respect for a man who was willing to literally put his life on the line because he believed in Jesus and believed in America. And what Charlie has stood for up to this point and what he has proclaimed and what he has shared around the country and across college campuses will not be silenced. And it will, that message will carry on. Because it's really not about any single one of us. It's about really the Lord and the way the Lord wants to use all of us. Don't shrink back because of this, folks. Don't be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the power of salvation to all who believe, first for the Jew, then the Gentile. And we must continue to be a beacon of light in a dark world, shining the light of Jesus Christ, trusting in him for our protection, trusting in him, that when things don't make sense like today, we will lean into him, that we will lean into the Lord, trust in him, not in our own understanding, but in all our ways, acknowledge him. He'll take care of us, he'll direct our paths. And I I want to close now, just praying again for Erica and for the girls. Isaiah 51, 12 says, God says, I even I am he who comforts you. And I pray for the Lord's comfort for Erica and for their girls, and for Charlie's parents, and for his friends, and I pray for healing for our nation. This will have a deep ripple effect across our country, just because of the influence that Charlie has had. And I pray for those of you in that Gen X and Gen Z generation. God is doing a new thing in your generation. And I pray that you would be courageous warriors for Jesus. And I pray that you will continue to fight the good fight of the faith, and that you will make him known wherever you go, that you will proclaim the goodness of the Lord and the favor of the Lord, and let him take what you say and translate it into the hearts of other people that they might know the liberating good news of Jesus Christ. Continue to love Jesus and love our country. And when you have the why questions, God can take them. But turn that into praise at the end of the day. Because he's a merciful God who has done bountifully toward us. Amen. Father, we just uh pray right now for Erica and for their girls, for Charlie's parents. I know, Lord, that we will see Charlie again because of his deep and profound faith in Jesus Christ. But because he has touched our lives here at Cornerstone by being here with us, we are more directly impacted than some people. So, Lord, our hearts are heavy tonight, and in our heaviness and in our grief, we just give you these things, Lord, and ask for you to minister to our hearts, and we just especially think of Erica and those girls, and just how crushed they are tonight. How those little girls won't even understand. They're too young to understand when mommy says, Daddy's gone to heaven. So, Lord, please bind up the brokenhearted and save those who are crushed in spirit. You are near to those who are grieving. You are near to those who are mourning. So we know that you are near to Erica and to those girls, and that you will hold them in the palm of your hand. You will comfort them, like you have comforted countless others who have lost loved ones in tragedies. Heal our land, Lord. Those who have either been successful or attempted to silence others through violence, Lord, heal our land. Would you please, Lord, fight against the evil in our world? That is so prevalent these days. It seems so common now. We turn around and we hear of some other shooting in a school or a synagogue or some other tragedy like this, Lord. And our hearts just break. For those who have lost loved ones, like our heart breaks for the Kirk family tonight. We ask, Lord, this has been our prayer for a long time. We ask, Lord, for revival in America, because we know that the hearts of people will not change unless Jesus comes into their hearts. Unless you, Lord, do a miraculous work to change the hearts of people who are bent on violence and hatred. Lord, you can save the most violent criminal. You can save the hardest heart and make it tender. Because you are God. We pray for the soul of that person who fired that shot. In our flesh, Lord, we we want justice. But Lord, you have been so merciful to us. We ask God for you to bring healing and comfort to all those who are mourning. And we thank you, Lord, for the promise of heaven. Even as Paul said to the Thessalonians, we grieve, but not like those who have no hope. And thank you for the hope of heaven. To be reunited with our loved ones and friends. I know, Lord, one day. We'll see Charlie Kirk again. He's probably even now preaching to people up there. Thank you for your mercy and your grace in our lives. And despite our pain and our sorrow. No matter what happens on earth, Lord, you are worthy of praise. You are high and lifted up and seated on the throne. And the train of your robe fills the temple. And you are God. I remember, Lord, in your word when David. When David's little baby died. And when that baby died, he got up from being on his face before you. And he went to your house to worship you. And even his attendant said, How can you worship at a time like this? And David said, I will not go to him. He knew that he would see that baby again. Because his hope was in you and our eternal reward. So Lord, we fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame. Sat down at the right hand of the Father. And so Lord, we fix our eyes on you. Not on this evil world. We fix our eyes on you. And we trust you to take care of the evil and for you to deal with those Lord who are disobedient and who offend you. But as far as us, Lord, we need your mercy ourselves. So we cry out for your mercy and your grace and your comfort. For every hurting heart and for the soul of America, Lord. May you sweep across our land and bring a great revival. That's our constant prayer mark. For the hope of America is more of you, Lord. So we thank you together. Be glorified as we worship you in song in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's stand and sing a few closing songs. How high the mountain I could not climb in desperation. Tore through the shadows of my soul. So great a mercy. What heart could fathom such boundless grace. Oh the God of ages. Step down from glory to wear my sin and bear my shame. The cross has spoken. The King of Kings calls me. Oh, I'm yours forever. Oh Jesus Christ, my living. Hallelujah. Praise the one who sent me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost his grief on me. You are broken every chain. Yes, salvation in your name. Jesus Christ. Praise the one who sent me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost his grief on me. You have broken every chain. Dear salvation in your name, Jesus Christ. Then came the mourning that sealed the promise. Your buried body began to breathe out of the silence. The roaring line. Oh declare the grave has no claim on me. Oh your rebody. Praise the one who sent me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost his grip on me. You have broken every chain. Jesus Christ. Oh hallelujah. Praise the one who sent me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost his creep on me. You have broken every chain. Their salvation in your name. Oh God, you are living home. Seated on high in the hands all. Oh Jesus when you set the stars in the names, you said the word into singing. Life and creation. And you want to learn your creation. Jesus, you alone. I've sent so I've searched the world for the love that could be. Oh, and nothing compares to the wonder all the earth sing. All the angels come Jesus, you alone. Oh, you worthy, Lord. Oh, you worthy. All creation sings worthy. All the heavens. Jesus alone. Oh Jesus, you alone. Shed your blood for creature. You broke the curse for our freedom. Jesus, Jesus. Oh yes, you rose. Oh, you rose from death with the morning. Oh, you come again in the other. Jesus, you alone. Oh Jesus, you alone. Oh your holy all the earth singing holy. All the angels cry. Jesus, you alone worthy, Lord. Oh thee, all creation. All the heavens only Jesus sing holy. Oh your worthy. I lift my voice and sing about my life to me. Jesus, you alone. So we give you our praise. We give you the glory. We give you the honor. Despite our circumstances, Lord, despite the evil of our world. We worship you high and lifted up, seated on the throne. And we just close, Lord, again, praying your comfort on the Kirk family. And that you would just strengthen our own hearts. Protect us, Lord, from evil. We just commit this time to you, Lord. Pray you'll reunite us again on Sunday as we gather once again in your house to worship you to study your word together. Thank you, Lord, for meeting us here tonight in Jesus' name. Everybody said God bless you guys. Thank you.",
