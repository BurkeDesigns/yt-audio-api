Like when when we pray in those desperate times and God answers the prayers, don't just say, okay, great, he got me out of a terrible thing, and then forget the Lord and move on. No. Those times when God answers our cries out of desperation, may it move us to a deeper walk with him. For tonight, we're gonna pray, and then we're gonna take a look at this final chapter here in 1 Kings, chapter 22. Let's have a word of prayer. Lord, it is good to be here together in your house and to come together in the middle of this week, and no matter how good or bad of a week we've had so far, it's just good to be in your house. And we just pray for you to strengthen our hearts, for you to use your word to minister to us tonight. We just thank you that we can come before you thirsty and hungry, and you fill us up and you refresh us. And so, Lord, especially for those who are weary or tired or they're going through things, uh, we just want to come before you and ask you, Lord, to do your good work in us tonight. We trust that you've been glorified through our worship. We know that you've heard our prayers, and now we ask, Lord, for you to be pleased as we study your word together. I I thank you for those who are here in person and those who are watching online tonight. We just lift all this up to you in Jesus' matchless name. And everybody said, Amen. So we left off here at uh the the at verse 9 in chapter 22. I'm gonna actually read the first nine verses just to orient ourselves and then and then we'll pick up from there. But before I even do that, once again, take a look at the at the wall for our map, because we're we're talking here about the divided kingdom of Israel, this the capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel, Samaria, the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah is Jerusalem. And if you remember up to this point, we've got a king in the north and a king in the south. The king in the north is Ahab, his wife is Jezebel. We're not done with, well, we're gonna get done with Ahab tonight, but not with Jezebel. She's into 2 Kings. The king to the south is Jehoshaphat. And there is stress and sometimes even war between the north and the south, but on this particular occasion, these two kings come together, Ahab and Jehoshaphat to fight a common enemy, and the common enemy that they are fighting is the king of Syria up in the north here, and that's Ben Hadad. And the battle is over a city that Ben Hadad has captured, which is really within the northern kingdom of Israel, and that is the city of Ramoth Gilead. And so Ahab, the king of the north, has enlisted the help of his uh brother in the south, Jehoshaphat, not literal brothers, but his Jewish brother in the south, and he's asked Jehoshaphat, fight with me against Ben Hadad to reclaim Ramoth Gilead that is in my kingdom of the north. And Jehoshaphat agrees. And so they come together, and Jehoshaphat is wiser. Ahab is a wicked king. And so Jehoshaphat suggests to Ahab, how about we seek the Lord and make sure that we're supposed to go to battle here and about Ramoth Gilead before we actually start fighting? Let's just see what the Lord wants. And so they gather the prophets of Israel to get a word from the Lord. The problem is, as we're gonna see here in the first few verses, if you remember from our our study last time, that all these prophets just tell Ahab what he wants to hear. They're not legit prophets, they're not really prophesying what the Lord says. These guys are just trying to appease King Ahab. And so let's let's let's uh jump back to verse one of chapter 22, get a running start here. It says, Now, now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel. And then it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel. Now I mentioned this last time. He's actually going up, he's going north, but because he's in Jerusalem, it's a high holy city. Anytime you read going from Jerusalem, it's always we're going down, whether it's north or south, because it's a high holy place. So he's going north, but it says here he went down from uh Judah to visit the king of Israel. And the king of Israel, this is Ahab, said to his servants, Do you know that Ramoth and Gilead is ours? But we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria. And so he said to Jehoshaphat, will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead? Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, please inquire for the word of the Lord today. Okay, so that's his advice. We better pray about this. We better seek the Lord before we just go into battle. And then the king of Israel, Ahab, gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain? And so they said, Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king. And so all four hundred prophets are like, Yes, you need to fight. And but Jehoshaphat could see through this. He's like, is there not a man who would possibly disagree? And Jehoshaphat said, this is verse 7, is there not still a prophet of the Lord here that we may inquire of him? Like this is this is a little unbelievable that all four hundred, just you know, without even really seeking the Lord, just say, Let's fight. And so the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Well, there is still one, one man named Micaiah, the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the Lord, but I hate him. I hate this guy. Why? Because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. Now that isn't true. Micaiah doesn't prophesy evil, but he's the only one who will tell Ahab the truth. And when Ahab does not get the answer that he wants, he thinks it's evil. This guy's evil, he's not for me. You know, he never is. And so Jehoshaphat said, Well, you know, you shouldn't say such a thing. He says, Let not the king say such things. Don't, you know, don't speak against the prophets of the Lord. And then the king of Israel called an officer and said, Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah quickly. So here's where we left off. So verse 10. The king of Israel, Ahab, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat on his throne at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. So we're in the capital of the northern kingdom. And all the prophets prophesied before them. So they they put on their royal robes, they're sitting together, they are waiting for these prophets to pass by them and to give the word of the Lord. And it mentions one prophet here by name, verse 11. Now Zedekiah, the son of Canaannah, had made horns of iron for himself, and he said, Thus says the Lord, with these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed. All right, so picture this. You got Jehoshaphat sitting on a throne, you got Ahab sitting on the throne, they're their buds for this moment, all right? And the prophets are parading in front of them, and one guy named here, Zedekiah, he's he's brought like visual aids here. He he comes with props, and he has made two iron horns, like, you know, like the horn of oxen or something. And he's got these horns, and he comes out, you know, and I'm envisioning like they're on his head. And he's like, you know what the Lord's told me? You two are like these two horns. You guys are gonna go into battle, and you're gonna just gore the Syrians. So he went to quite the effort to bring the props here. And it says that with these, when he said, with these you shall gore the Syrians until they destroyed, it says in verse 12, and all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth, Gilead and prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hands. And then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah, spoke to him, saying, Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord, encourage the king. Please let your word be like the word of one of them and speak encouragement. All right, so Ahab sends this messenger. You know, this messengers heard what the four hundred prophets have said, which are not really the word of the Lord. When he goes to Micaiah, this messenger says, Okay, now listen, just before we go, you need to understand all these four hundred prophets, they're all saying the same thing. And it'll be a good day if you would just agree with that, so that Ahab can hear an encouraging word. You got that? So just agree. Just agree with them. Would you please? Micaiah said in verse 14, as the Lord lives, whatever the Lord says to me, that I will speak. So that's a good answer, right? It's like, uh all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say what the Lord tells me to say. And then he came to the king to Ahab, and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we? We refrain. And he answered him, go and prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king. All right, now, please note with me. He is saying what the other prophets said, but he does not mean it. You look at some of the ancient rabbis, and they wrote a commentary about this that Micaiah must have been using a mocking tone. So Micaiah knows Ahab hates him. Ahab's already admitted it. There's been many times, obviously in the past where Micaiah has said things Ahab doesn't want to hear. And so he's standing in front of Ahab and Ahab goes, okay, Micaiah, what do you say? He's like, Yeah, I mean, whatever, man. Just go. You want to go? Go. Go. And he's using a mocking tone here. And the king knows, because the king said to him, How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord? So Ahab knows, like, oh man, you're not being honest with me. We're playing this game here. And then he said, So now, now Micaiah is gonna give the real word. He's like, okay, Ahab, you want me to tell you the truth? Are you serious? You want to hear the truth? Fine, I'm gonna tell you the truth. And Micaiah says, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd. All right, now please note that with me, because what Micaiah is actually prophesying here in part is the death of King Ahab, because he's saying to him, I saw your people, the people of Israel, but it was like they had, they were like sheep without a shepherd. And Ahab would have understood, he's talking about him. You're you're the shepherd, you're the king of the people. But in the vision that the Lord showed me, the people had no shepherd, the sheep had no shepherd. He goes on and he says, And the Lord said, These have no master, let each return to his house in peace. So Micaiah is telling him, he says, You know, I see this vision, but it's not a vision of victory. It is a vision of the Israelites being scattered like sheep who have no shepherd, and the Lord says, the master is not here, so let all the people return to their homes in peace. And the king of Israel, Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? I told you so. I hate this guy. And then Micaiah said, now this gets even more sobering. Then Micaiah said, Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by on his right hand and on his left. And the Lord said, Who will persuade Ahab to go up that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? And so one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner. Now, this is all Micaiah's prophecy. And he says, Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said to him, in what way? And so he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall persuade him and also prevail, go out and do so. Therefore, look, Micaiah says, The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has declared disaster against you. Now let me unpack this a little bit because this is a very interesting prophetic word that Ahab that uh that Micaiah gives to Ahab. Micaiah sees by the Spirit of God a vision of heaven and a scene in heaven of the Lord having a conversation. And who is the Lord having a conversation with? Well, it says here, Micaiah says that in back in verse 19, I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven, these are angelic beings, the host of heaven standing by on his right and on his left. And the Lord said, Who will persuade Ahab to go up that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So I want you to picture the scene. The Lord is on his throne, and he is surrounded by angelic beings. Now, some are on the right and some are on the left. It doesn't specifically say this part that I'm about to say, but it's probably indicative of the fact that angels who are right and good and pure are on his right. The angels who are fallen angels are on his left. This is a scene of angelic beings presenting before the Lord, and you have good angels, and you have bad fallen angels. Now, how do we know that there are some bad fallen angels here? Because one steps forward when the Lord asks the question, who will persuade Ahab to go up that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? In other words, God is saying, I'm gonna bring judgment on Ahab. Which of you, angelic beings, want to be used to accomplish my purposes? The angels that are surrendered to God and are good and have not rebelled against him, are not gonna volunteer to put a lying spirit in the mouths of the prophets of Ahab. This is a fallen angel. This is a demonic principality. Now you might say, why in the world would fallen angels still be in the presence of the Lord? Let me refer you to the book of Job. You don't need to turn there, but I will just briefly read a scene in the book of Job where there is a similar scene of angelic beings in the presence of God around the throne of God. Sometimes we think of, since since Lucifer rebelled against God, and God expelled Lucifer along with the angels who were a part of this attempted coup when Lucifer rebelled against God, and God expelled them from heaven. Some people think that they no longer have any access to God's presence, but in fact, in the book of Job, we see very clearly that they still do when God allows for it. And so in Job chapter one, it says this. Now, the sons of God, our Old Testament was written originally in Hebrew, the sons of God, that phrase is Banaiha Elohim, Banahi Elohim, and it always refers to angelic beings. So these angelic beings, the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, continuing to read, and Satan also came among them. And the Lord said to Satan, from where do you come? And Satan answered the Lord and said, from going to and fro on the earth and from walking back and forth on it. See, remember when Lucifer or Satan, or the adversary, literally Satan in Hebrew, the adversary, when he was kicked out of heaven because of his rebellion, then earth becomes his playground. And Satan in the unseen realm and the angels that rebelled with him are demons in the unseen realm. They still wander the earth. On this occasion in Job chapter one, for whatever reason, God calls them to present themselves before him, and among them Satan is there, and he's, and God says, Where have you been? And he goes, Well, I've been, you know, walking and roaming the earth, and that's when this whole dialogue now happens between Satan and the Lord about Job. And Satan accuses him and basically says, you know, Job is only righteous because you know you blessed him, you take away your blessing, and he's mine, and that's when God allows Satan to have his way. I mean, it it seems to us like, why would God allow that? But the book of Job is a good reminder to us of how there is spiritual warfare in the heavenlies that we don't understand, and yet God is faithful to see Job through it all, and Job ends up being an example to us of a man who in the midst of terrible pain, adversity, and suffering, trusted the Lord, and in the end the Lord uh honored Job and Job came through it, but but it was this, you know, cosmic thing that was happening in the unseen realm. By the way, it's very interesting in your Bibles, there are only three times that Satan speaks recorded in Scripture. The first time that he speaks in Genesis, Satan accuses God to man. Did God really say? In the book of Job is the second time that Satan speaks, he accuses man to God. He accuses Job. Job's only righteous because you blessed him. And the third, and the last time that we have recorded conversation of Satan is in Luke 4, when Satan tries to tempt Jesus, and in that case, he accuses the God man. He accuses Jesus and tries to tempt Jesus. So in Job, you have this scene of Satan with other angelic beings presenting themselves before the Lord. It's a similar thing back here in 1 Kings 22 that Micaiah is seeing by the Spirit. He is seeing angelic preachers in the presence of the throne of God. And God asks this question, basically, I'm going to. Paraphrase, who's going to accomplish my purposes in bringing judgment to Ahab. And this one angelic creature steps forward and says, I'll put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets to persuade Ahab to do something that will result in Ahab's death. This is God's judgment. Because remember, Ahab was a wicked king. He followed the influence of his wife Jezebel, who, because she was the daughter of an occult priest, that Ahab should never have married. She didn't follow the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And thus he introduced a higher level of idolatry in the land of Israel. And for that, God is now gonna judge Ahab. He's been very patient with Ahab. He's given Ahab many chances. God is a gracious God, but at a point we can test his patience, and eventually God will bring judgment if we don't turn. Ahab did not turn. So this is the method that God is going to use to accomplish his judgment in the life of Ahab. This this demonic principality says, I will put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets, and God agrees to this. Now, now please notice also, you know, Satan does not have, or demonic principalities do not have just free reign. There are things that have to pass by the desk of God. You remember when Jesus, in the last Passover meal that he shared with his disciples, what we sometimes call the Last Supper, Jesus even mentions to Peter, and he says to Peter to forewarn him, although Peter didn't really heed it, but he says, Jesus said to Peter, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat. And after you have failed, restore your brothers. Like he even predicts, Peter, you're gonna fail. You're gonna deny me three times. But afterwards, like restore them. Like, I'm not done with you. But it's interesting how Jesus starts that that statement when he says, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat. So nothing, you know, that they they don't have just free reign. And so this one principality says, I'll put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets, and God gives permission, because God's purposes are going to be accomplished in this way. And that's why these 400 prophets speak lies to Ahab, because they've actually been influenced by demonic principalities. So they might, who who knows? These prophets might think that they're actually telling the truth, but they've been so deceived by a lying spirit that they're all saying the same thing, and it's all lies. So that Ahab then takes the advice of these false prophets, not the advice of Micaiah, and he's gonna end up going to war. And we will see the result of it. So, pick up again, reading with me here in verse 24. It says, Now Zedekiah, the son of Canaan, went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the spirit from the Lord go from me to speak to you? Um that's roughly translated. Since when did God's spirit leave me to speak through you? You know, Zedekiah had this prophecy, you know, the horns, right? And he's like, You guys are supposed to go and gore the Syrians, and Micaiah's like, I don't think so. And so Zedekiah, you know, hits him. It's it's you know, things haven't changed, friends. It's like if if somebody doesn't like what you say, and they don't have an argument, and and they don't have the ability to at least let you have a different opinion, they're gonna resort to violence. Aren't we seeing that in our culture today? It's it's like, you know, I I don't, I what's worse than canceling you is I'm just gonna be violent against you because I don't like what you're saying. It's like, you know, how pitiful to resort to violence. Zedekiah just smacks him. Uh instead of, instead of just, you know, saying, I have a different opinion, Micaiah. Let's, you know, let's talk this through. It just hits him. And um, and Micaiah said in verse 25, indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide. Like you, you'll wait and see. You're you're gonna be hiding. And so the king of Israel said, so now this is Ahab again speaking here. The king of Israel said, verse 26, take Micaiah and return him to Ammon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son, and say, Thus says the king, put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I come in peace. So Ahab doesn't like what Micaiah is saying, and it's interesting. Please take note when the king the king of Israel speaks, he says, Take Micaiah and return him to Ammon the governor. In other words, it appears that Micaiah was already in prison, and that's where they fetched him from, because they're saying, return him to Ammon, the governor of the city. Now, this is the only time that this particular Ammon is mentioned, he is the governor of Samaria. So you have Ahab is the king of the northern kingdom, Samaria is the capital city, and there's a governor appointed over the capital city. His name is Ammon, return him to Ammon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son. Now, Ahab did not have a son named Joash. He had two other sons mentioned in the Bible, Ahaziah and Jehoram. He had those two sons. Ahaziah is gonna succeed Ahab as the next king of Israel. But and the Bible says Ahaziah had no sons, so his brother Jehoram becomes king after Ahaziah. There is no Joash, the king's son, and so Bible scholars believe that Joash is not a biological son, but he's a court official in the king's court, and Ahab loves him like a son, but it's not probably a literal son, and this is the only time this particular Joash is mentioned. There's other Joashes. In fact, there's a king of Israel named Joash, there's a king of Judah named Joash, but it's not this guy. So they're returning Micaiah, return him. And the the order that the king gives is put him back in prison and just give him bread and water until I come in peace. Well, he ain't gonna come in peace. Because we're gonna see here what happens. But Micaiah said, if you ever return in peace, the Lord has not spoken to me, and he said, Take heed all you people. In other words, Micaiah realizes you're not gonna return in peace, because he's just prophesied the death of Ahab. And uh, and so Micaiah says, if you end up coming back, then I'm not a real prophet. And he tells all the people, you better take heed. Well, here we go. And so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth Gilead. They're gonna go to war now. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, and you gotta love this, I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel, Ahab disguised himself and went into battle. You get what this guy's doing? This guy's a wicked guy. He's like Jehoshaphat, you know, we're both going into war together, but why don't you put on your royal robes and stand out like a king? I'm gonna put on camo if you don't mind. And we'll go into battle, but you you just have on your royal robes. I'm just gonna go in camo and you know, some black stuff on my underneath my eyes, and it's gonna be great. And and so he's just like throwing Jehoshaphat under the bus. Stand out like a king, let him go after you. Verse 31. And now the king of Syria, that's Benadad, had commanded the 32 captains of his chariots, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel. Like, I just want Ahab. Go after him. And so it was when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. They thought it, they thought it was Ahab, because of the royal robes. And therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out. Now, what's beautiful about your Bible is that the best commentary in the Bible is the Bible, and 2 Chronicles gives is a parallel book to what is happening here, and in 2 Chronicles, it gives us just a little more insight. So I'm just gonna read quickly from 2 Chronicles. Um, and it's the same scene, but listen, it gives us a little more detail and says this. This is 2 Chronicles chapter uh 18, verse 31. So it was when the captains of the chariot saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel, therefore they surrounded him to attack, but Jehoshaphat cried out, he's crying out to the Lord, and the Lord helped him, and God diverted them from him. So this is Jehoshaphat seeking God in the hour of his need, and God diverts the army of Ben Hadad away from Jehoshaphat. God protects Jehoshaphat. For those of you taking notes, we're looking at these different principles. Here's one God responds to the desperate cries of his people. This is the heart of God. He hears our prayers in these desperate times. Jehoshaphat is in this desperate situation. He cries out to the Lord, he asks for the Lord to deliver him, and the Lord does. Now I want to read one more thing to you out of 2 Chronicles chapter 19, verse 4, because this is a great statement on when Jehoshaphat realizes that God has delivered him, and he goes back to Judah to the southern kingdom. I want you to hear what he does. This is this is 2 Chronicles 19 4. So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim. And brought them back to the Lord, God of their fathers. You understand what he does here? He realizes God spared my life. He heard my cry in my desperate times. And it motivated him, it moved him to return to the Lord and to bring revival to the whole nation of Judah. And so this is another important point, friends. When God responds, it should move us to a deeper walk with him. Like when we pray in those desperate times and God answers the prayers, don't just say, okay, great. No. Those times when God answers our cries out of desperation, may it move us to a deeper walk with him, as it did with Jehoshaphat. So go back to our story here. Verse 33, and it happened when the captains of the chariot saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. Now a certain man drew a bow at random, somebody from the Syrian army. Notice, and struck the king of Israel, Ahab, between the joints of his armor. And so he said to the driver, now Ahab says to the driver of his chariot, turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded. So, you know, this uh this soldier within the Syrian army is just fighting, and he, you know, fires an arrow, and God directs it right between the joints of Ahab's armor. This guy doesn't know that Ahab is the king, just you know, in camo. He he's just fighting in the battle, but God knows. And it says here, and the battle increased that day, and the king, Ahab, was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. You know, I have to say, Ahab died more courageously than he lived, because he decides, just prop me up in my chariot, let me face the Syrians, so that it would encourage his army to continue fighting, even though he knows he's dying. And he does die. And the blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot, and then as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the army, saying, Every man to his city and every man to his own country. And so the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. And then someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs looked up his blood while the harlots bathed, according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken. Back in chapter 21, verse 19, Elijah the prophet had said that Ahab would die and dogs would lick his blood. It came to pass here. Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? And so Ahab rested with his fathers, and then Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place. And then the last part of this chapter deals with Jehoshaphat. Now, in 1 Kings here, Jehoshaphat only gets one chapter. When we get later to 2 Chronicles, he gets four chapters. So there's not much written about him, but here's what it says. Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel. Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king, and he reigned 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhai. And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa, which is good. Asa was a good king. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord. So Jehoshaphat for the most part was a good king. But it says, nevertheless, the high places were not taken away, for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places. Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. So that was not pleasing to the Lord, because Ahab was a wicked king. Jehoshaphat joined forces with him against Ben Haddad. So there are a couple of marks against Jehoshaphat, but otherwise he was a pretty good king. It says, now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And the rest of the perverted persons, that's interesting. Some of your footnotes say those practicing sodomy and prostitution in religious rituals. So these are, these are religious uh prostitutes here. And the rest of the perverted persons who remained in the days of his father Esau, he banished from the land. There was no king in Edom, only a deputy king. Now Edom was a foreign country, but why does it say that? Next verse. Jehoshaphat made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they never sailed, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Gaber. Well, Azion Gaber is an Edom, so that's where these ships were made. And it's interesting here, you know, Jehoshaphat is going to recover some gold in Ophir. We don't really know where Ophir was. But it says the ships were wrecked at Ezion Gaber. Now, look, 2 Chronicles 20, you don't need to turn there. It tells us specifically, God wrecked the ships. And God wrecked the ships because Jehoshaphat had formed a peaceful alliance with Ahab. And God was against that. So he's like, You ain't going to go get gold. You think I'm going to let you be rewarded financially for this? So he wrecked the ships. It says, and then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, let my servants go with your servants in the ships, but Jehoshaphat would not. In other words, Jehoshaphat learned, I can't have this alliance with you anymore. God wrecked these ships. So no Ahaziah. And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, his father, Jerusalem. And then Jehoram, his son, reigned in his place. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. By the way, I forgot to put up the last point. Here it is, number three. God is free to wreck our plans when they go against his. God wrecked the ships because they were not part of God's plans. God is free to do that in our lives, to wreck the plans that are not his. Verse 52, he that's Ahaziah did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who had made Israel sin. For he served Baal, that's one of the foreign gods of the Canaanites, and worshipped him and provoked the Lord, God of Israel to anger according to all that his father had done. So, like father like son, unfortunately, Ahaziah is learning from his dad and his mother, Jezebel. Ahab is dead. Um we we learn of Jezebel's death. It's pretty brutal. I think it's in chapter seven of 2 Kings. Um yeah, well, chapter, no, it's in chapter 9. So we'll get to that, Lord willing. Um, but what a way to end, right? What a way to end. Let's pray. Lord, thank you that you respond to the desperate cries of your people. And we pray, God, that when you do respond in wonderful and amazing ways, that it would move us to walk deeper with you, as it did with Jehoshaphat. I pray, God, that we would not receive your merciful responses and then forget you. But may the times that you see us through the difficulties draw us even closer to you. And Lord, you have the freedom to wreck our plans when they're not your plans. But we pray on the front end that we would walk in the ways of the Lord, that we would not do things that are inconsistent with your purposes and your plans, but we might seek your face and walk in step with your spirit. May we learn from the book of first kings, Lord, from the good of it and the bad of it, as we go through every book of your word, that you might teach us, that you might draw us closer to yourself, that you might continue to shape us and mold us to be more like Jesus. May we read these things and take these things to heart. And we thank you, Lord, for this book that we have finished now. We just pray God you would continue to use it to minister to us and be with us as we go to our homes tonight, bring us back together on Sunday. We love you and praise you together in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen and amen. God bless everybody.",
