  "transcript": "I always love the Sunday after Thanksgiving because it's a wonderful time to review God's goodness and his faithfulness to our church. And so this Sunday, we've been doing for the last eight years, the Sunday after Thanksgiving is a time for us just to recall this past year. What has God done that is so wonderful and amazing? And I will tell you the reason that we started doing this was because I had lunch with a gentleman from our church about 10 years ago, and he has since gone on to be with the Lord. I will tell this story every year, just so that you know my heart behind why we do this. Because at that lunch meeting, David kept saying to me respectfully, and he was from he was from England, so he's like, Gary, Gary, why don't we do this and do that as a church? How come we're we're not involved in this? How come we don't do that? And and the other. And so he he laid out all these all these different things, and I said to him, David, we actually do all those things. And he said, Really? And it wasn't that he was uninformed, it was that we hadn't done our job to explain the different things that are happening around here. And the reason why I usually err on the side of not talking about stuff that we do is because I just don't want to get near that line of taking any glory from the Lord. Oh, look what Cornerstone does and patting ourselves on the back. So please understand when David said this to me, and because his response when I said we do all these things, he was like, Why aren't you letting the congregation know so that we can join in thanksgiving to God? And that just really convicted me that at least once a year, we can just kind of pull back the curtain of some of the inner workings here at Cornerstone to let you know what God has been up to. But please know the emphasis is on what God has been up to. And we are just giving thanks and glory to God for all that he has done, and this is our annual year to our annual Sunday to do that year after year. So I'll open up with uh uh Exodus 15 11. It simply says this. Who is like you, Lord among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders. Like, in other words, there is no one else like the Lord who has done marvelous things, awesome and glorious deeds, doing wonders that we couldn't even really imagine. And so God has always wowed us year after year. Well, every year we've been doing this for the last eight years. One of our elders, Marwan Rifka has been giving you the update, but we're about to pass the torch today, and Marwan will explain a little bit more. So welcome our one rifka as he comes. Good morning. In 1998, my family relocated to this area, and we found the church pretty quickly, and we, my wife and I have been blessed, we've been part of the church for 27 years now. And during that time, we just really involved ourselves in the church. We volunteer, we open doors, we greet people, we ushered, we served in the children's ministry, whatever it took just to be part of the church. I say that to encourage you. If you're you or just routinely here, do that part of your part of being who part of Corner Stone Chapel is. You'll be a blessing to others, but trust me, you will get a big blessing from doing so as we have experienced it. So I also had a joy and blessing and privilege of serving on the Timothy Council, which is the board of elders for the church for over 20 years. Now, during those years that we've been here, there have been a lot of changes at Coronstone Chapel, but at the same time, they're very big constants that we have. Example changes is what building do we meet. First it was a school, then the strip mall, then God bless us with this facility. So those are changes of where we meet. We used to have 10 services for Easter and Christmas. Now we can do them here with 10 services. Next year we'll do, we'll start in mid-November, maybe for the middle of the services. But we have people who come to us, they hear the word and they want to worship here with us at this church. We have people who join us and be part of our staff. We are well, we welcome people who come and want to contribute to the church in whatever way they are. But the constant thing that has never changed is who what makes Gordon Stone Chapel. So lots of changes happening, but who we are. For example, I always list those things. There's always been a very big, I've felt it and we've noticed it, God's favor on our church. Not we don't pat ourselves on the back, we are just thankful for his favor. Why we also we think it's because we just preach and teach God's word from the Bible. We make him known. We make him known also through serving our church body, our community, you around the U.S., around the world, we do that to make him known. That's the reason we do that. We also uh are very thankful for who you are. You make the church, you are generous in your giving, your tithe and giving. And we have been, and we will pray we'll always be good stewards in what has been provided to us. But today we have a constant and a change. Again, like Pastor Garrett said, I've been blessed to be able to give those updates just to share what we have witnessed in the past year. So that's gonna be a constant. But the change is we have our executive pastor, Andy Wagner, who is gonna give the update today. So please welcome Pastor Andy. Thank you, Marwan. So excited to be with you today on this Thanksgiving weekend. Yes, the methods change, but the mission stays the same. So if you'll turn in your Bibles to Psalm 100, if you brought your Bibles, turn to Psalm 100. As Pastor Gary shared, we started doing this several years ago, and we quickly realized how much of a blessing it was to us and the congregation to look back and discuss all that God has done. Not that it necessarily should have surprised us, but as a growing church over the years, sometimes we can get busy just focusing on what keeping up with what God is doing. Do we have enough chairs for everyone? Do we have enough food? Do we have enough parking spaces? Do we have enough Bibles? And then after that event or service is over, then we just would look to the next event. And sometimes that got in the way of us making the time or taking the time to look back and reflect at what God has done. And so today we take a breath this weekend to reflect, to look back, to celebrate what God has done and what we are thankful for. So we're gonna start in Psalm 100. I memorized uh Psalm 100 as a kid, and uh I realized that as I as I look back at Psalm 100, and so if you ever think about our children's ministry, if you ever think about your kids memorizing scripture, um, it took me about reading about through this about twice before I picked it up, and I could read it again by memory, even though I hadn't looked at this um chapter or memorized it since I was about 10 years old. Psalm 100, this is the only psalm. There's 150 Psalms, this is the only one titled A Psalm of Thanksgiving. And so we're gonna read this today. Um says this make a joyful shout to the Lord, all ye lands, serve the Lord with gladness, come before his presence with singing. Know that the Lord He is God, it is He who has made us and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise. Be thankful to him and bless his name, for the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting, and his truth endures to all generations. As we look back and reflect, one of the first things we want to be share and be thankful for that verse two of how much our church serves the Lord with gladness. We are thankful today for our volunteers. In fact, if you volunteered for anything in 2025 in any capacity, would you just stand so that we could applaud you? Just to show you how much we rely on our volunteers. Just on a Sunday morning, we rely on 350 volunteers. Think about all the different positions that we have in children's ministry from nursery all the way up through middle school. Think about the parking lot attendance and the rain and the sleep this morning, helping everyone find a spot, our greeters, our ushers, our security that keeps the building secure, our nursery, our food service, all those playing instruments and singing on stage with worship, um, our middle school um volunteers and those in video and audio that capture what we do here and make sure that people can view it online. Uh we are thankful for our volunteers, 350 each Sunday, and then over the course of the year, 3,000 different opportunities to volunteer that are filled by our congregation. We are thankful for our volunteers. Um, whether you're holding a baby in the nursery or you're helping park a car, or you're passing out candy at the harvest party, uh playing an instrument, teaching or singing with third graders. Or you're passing out food or diapers or firewood to the community at one of our service projects. You are serving the Lord with gladness, and we are so thankful. Your reputation throughout the town of Leesburg and throughout Loudoun County goes before you. We are known as a community, as a community of believers that serves. I was just speaking with a captain of Leesburg Police Department, and he mentioned that out of the blue. So thankful for the congregation here at Cornerstone because your reputation is one of a reputation as a congregation that serves the community, and we are thankful for you. The largest community outreach that we do every year is our annual harvest party. You saw pictures of our harvest party. We just had this about a month ago. We had over 150 volunteers and staff come together. Our harvest party is basically we just throw a party for our community as an alternative to Halloween, and we had over 6,000 people come to our harvest party this year. So we're so thankful for our U.S. outreach team with along with the volunteers that's able to put that event on with food and games and candy, and that's just one example of how our U.S. outreach team blesses the community. U.S. Outreach is a team that helps those in our congregation. They help those in the community, locally and across the United States to help with uh food needs, to help with job needs, to help with house repairs, um, to help with construction, um, to help with housing, and just in our community alone, our team totaled over 1,000 volunteer hours, and we're able to serve over 17 service projects and three distribution events to help supply the community with food and supplies. And to give you a better idea of what our U.S. outreach team is all about, here's a video of just one of the families that we were able to help this year. My name is Joy. I was born in China. I live with my mom and dad and my two younger siblings. China is a country that only believed government, and they persecuted all the religion. One day when my dad is preaching at our church, there is an undercover cop coming to our house, and he yelled at us, saying that we can't have a church here. He is really upset. He pushed my dad down the stairs, and my dad got hit in the head really bad, and he broke his leg. I also raised scared that my I gonna lose my parents, and then probably they're gonna go to jail. We just decided to move to a safe place. One day, a friend of ours told us that Virginia is a great place to live, and after many prayers, we decided to move there. The first day that we attended at Cornerstone Church. So we got connected with the U.S. outreach team, and they helped us a lot with our apartment, and also they helped me with my school. When we lived in China, we didn't dare to admit our identity. We could not freely preach or share the gospel of God with others. When I came to the United States, being a Christian country, I could honorably tell others I am a pastor. It was also the first time we came to Cornerstone, and yet we were treated like family. We were helped in so many ways. We were very touched as though we had joined a big family. This is a church where God's presence is here, a church blessed by him. We are willing to commit ourselves to this church to glorify God's name here, to preach the gospel, and to help this church become a blessing to many more people. We are truly grateful to God and thankful to all the brothers and sisters in the church who have given of themselves. May the almighty God bless every pastor and worker who has served us. We thank the church for accepting us, for loving us, for embracing us. You have helped us settle down here in an apartment, helped our children go to school so that we don't feel like strangers in a foreign country. You have helped us quickly adapt to life here, helped us learn English, and allowed us to fully integrate into this big American family and society. Thank you also for taking care of our children, making them feel secure and settled. May God's blessings be with you all. Amen. We are thankful for our U.S. outreach team. Outside of the 17 local projects, the outreach team went on five different trips to Asheville, North Carolina as well to help clean up and rebuild after Hurricane Helene and dozens of you went on those five trips. We also want to mention how many shoeboxes were collected. Our U.S. outreach team hosts our Operation Christmas Child. And so all the shoe boxes were brought back last week, and uh 6500 boxes in total were brought back into this building. We know that 4500 boxes were here locally, 1,200 were boxes were um created online, and then another 600 boxes uh were made by our students at Cornerstone Christian Academy, so totaling 6500 boxes that were able to go out. Um, so we're thankful for that as well. Obviously, every active service, whether in our backyard or around the country is an opportunity to carry out our mission. Um, although the methods change over the years, the myth that mission of making him known stays the same, and we celebrate our local U.S. outreach. We also have a global outreach team. So the global outreach team focuses on making him known around the world, and we're thankful for global outreach. This year we took six trips to four different countries and have a video for you that highlights all those trips, followed by a video that highlights just one of the trips that we took to Uganda. So take a look at the screens, uh, the community of the community. The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is doing big things in Uganda. Known as the Pearl of Africa, for the beauty of its natural landscapes, it is the home of the source of the Nile River and over 50 million souls. While many modern advancements have found their way to the cities of Uganda, there are still remote villages without clean water, enough food to eat, or the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is where we go. To the villages in the bush of Africa that previously had no roads to access them, no wells to draw water from, no agriculture to sustain life. These are the villages where witchcraft once ruled, but now we're overcome by the love of Jesus and the power of his name. These are the villages where Jesus now reigns, and we have the privilege to join in the work he is already doing. These villages are now filled with the laughter of children, songs of praise, and the teaching of God's holy word. There is so much more to be done, so many souls that are yet to be reached and lives God longs to change. This is why we go, because we believe in making him known, not just in our own communities, but around the world, where the Holy Spirit is constantly on the move. God is doing big things in Uganda, and we are honored to be a part of it. God has built so many leaders in and around the community because they see again and again and again and again and countless again what God is doing through medicine and the gospel and what Jesus Christ is doing to change lives and industry it's just amazing. God's love is like so evident here and I like have never felt it this extreme anywhere I've been. When you come here and you see all these people that are so full of the Holy Spirit. That would have never happened, but God made a way and made a miracle at something that they didn't think possible. Amen. While we're not able to visit all of our missionaries around the world, we are able to celebrate them and support them through our Christmas catalog. And so Global Outreach has created a Christmas catalog that allows you to support and be helpful. Pastor Austin talked about this catalog during our announcement time. And so this catalog allows us to support our missionaries. And so for example last year through this catalog our congregation gave 27,000 dollars for food and water and livestock distribution. So you think livestock distribution that went to 10 oxen with yolks and plows to plow the fields for a church family in rural Haiti. We also gave 39,000 to provide for education in schools and vocational and job training. About which half of went to buy an anesthesia machine for a medical clinic in Uganda. 34,000 went to purchase Bibles including 2,000 Bibles in the Pakistani language in China and the Czech Republic, each Bible in their own language. We also purchased a new vehicle for a missionary in Chile and another new vehicle for a missionary in Hungary. We also were able to to buy 115 sets of blankets and pillows for an orphanage that we support at Malawi. $10,500 for sewing machines were purchased and given to refugees in Egypt so that they could sew and support their families. So overall last year through this catalog 856 individual donations came in for a total of over $275,000. So thankful so thankful for the global outreach ministry and the generosity of those who participated with that catalog. And if you're interested in supporting the missionaries this Christmas donations of any amount are welcome there's a table in the atrium where you can find out more pick up the catalog and you can visit our global page on our website. Well we also want to thank God for those who worship with us across the U.S. and around the world we have 176 K groups or Koinonia groups around the U.S. Most of them in Loudon County in in this area and then in addition we have nine official watch groups that come together to watch our services and countless unofficial watch groups that get together each week to study God's word through Pastor Gary's teachings including one group in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and this group wanted to say hi to us today. Hello Cornerstone Chapel we are a watch group that meets every Sunday morning here in Lancaster County Pennsylvania we participate in every part of the service including singing greeting and communion we end our time praying together and have other times of fellowship. We love being a part of Cornerstone Chapel and are so thankful to God for our group and the people that he continues to bring to us keep in mind that whenever we hear the words welcome to our online viewers here is our reaction that's awesome we just found out the only time they weren't cheering is when they were told they can't go to Israel no they just have to wait a week before they sign up that's but we did have a lot of people watching online that went to Israel with us a month ago and what we were amazed about were how invested they were with the church they give financially they're invested in our website they follow us on Sundays and Wednesdays they follow our Tuesday morning and Tuesday evening women's Bible studies. Many of them were connected and participating enrolled in our C CBI that meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays they follow our men's Bible study on Fridays. They know more about the church than I do. They are they pay attention to our announcements ask great questions and we're so thankful for those watch groups the one in Lancaster and all around the U.S. that can't make it here in person but they do make the effort to come together each week to watch our services and build community the next slide that I have is a map and all of those dots represent prisons where the inmates are able to hear our services through a free app. This is 410 prisons across 37 states are able to listen to our services for that is a fairly new app that was made um available to them and because of this app we get emails we get letters from those asking for Bibles asking with prayer requests and we're thankful for those who were able to watch the next slide is a map of radio stations we are on the radio and you can listen to Pastor Gary on the radio in 691 cities across 45 states and even three cities in New Zealand that get the radio station so that we're able to share the gospel with those around the US. Also around the world I remember sharing we were talking over a Thanksgiving several years ago where we were so excited that uh that our um messages went around the world in 25 different countries and then we looked in at into it this year and found out that today our services are reaching 122 countries around the world and so we're thankful for the online viewers so we have people watching from Denmark and Jordan and Kuwait and Fiji and Nepal in Croatia and we're thankful for those viewers across the country and around the world on YouTube, on Facebook and on our website despite the fact that we don't spend any money or energy trying to promote build subscribers or viewerships. So in other words as God has his word tells us as his word goes out as his name is lifted up he draws all men to himself and people are watching in prisons and on the radio and around the world opening their eyes and giving them a desire to learn and grow and learn more about Jesus and so we're thankful for those who join us and watch online this is typically one of Marwan's favorite areas to share about and uh I'll try to do as good a job as he does despite the fact that I don't have the financial acumen nor the Lebanese accent but uh I will do my best as a church this year we are on pace to donate over five million dollars to those in need locally and around the world so many of those things we've highlighted today praise God praise God for his provision we're also able to continue to support the ministry of Cornerstone Christian Academy helping to keep tuition low and providing hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships to those in financial needs last month on campus we started renovation of our kindergarten building and we're pleased to announce to our high school students at CCA that when they become a senior their senior trip will join us on a on a trip to Israel. So we were excited about that and they were excited about the opportunity to go to Israel and also the fact that we're going to provide partial scholarships for each student that wants to go regarding expansion at the school we would love to move forward with campus expansion projects like more athletic fields additional classrooms larger auditoriums we know these projects will cost millions of dollars and if you'd like to support that endeavor you can give to the church via our education fund we also wanted to share that because of your generosity over the years our entire campus here including our ministry building including our courtyard we are entirely debt free. So praise God for that we continue to aggressively pay down the debt that we have on renovating our campus at Cornerstone Christian Academy and we look forward to being completely debt free on that campus in less than a year and a half. So praise God for that Different ways to give if reminder if you haven't moved your new giving system to the My CC, we encourage you to do so. We think over half of you have already done that. Um, so do that before the new year. You'll be able to access your end of your giving statement through MyCC, and you'll be able to set up recurring giving if you'd like to do so. You can also download the Cornerstone Chapel mobile app and log in using your new MyCC login credentials. This will give you access to the teaching library.

And if you have any questions, you can email our accounting department at accounting at Cornerstonechapel.net. We are thankful for God's provision. Finally, today we want to celebrate new believers. As you can tell, the mission here at Cornerstone is to make him make him known. And so far this year, we've had 1,500 people make decisions to follow Jesus. And so we're so thankful for that. These decisions have been made in our Sunday services, on Easter, Christmas Eve, at our retreats around the world on our mission trips, our revival night, our youth camps. So we're excited about those who have made decisions. In addition, we've given away over a thousand Bibles to people here at Cornerstone, as well as sending Bibles for free to anyone who's requested one across the U.S. or even abroad. And to make decisions public, we've celebrated by baptizing over 950 people here at Cornerstone in our courtyard and in pools and lakes around the world. And so we wanted to celebrate that as well. And to celebrate with us, take a look at this video. And we do look forward to Christmas in the new year season, but we do want to make sure that we took time to reflect, to look back, to celebrate what God has done through you as you've served the Lord with gladness and as you've given generously from your hearts. And our hope is that as we look back with Thanksgiving, God will fill our hearts with peace and hope for the future as we look in anticipation, knowing that God is faithful. Amen. Let's pray. God, we have come into your presence with singing. We've entered into your gates with thanksgiving. We recognize that you are good, that your mercy is everlasting, and that your truth endures through all generations. God, we ask that you continue to guide us, you continue to find us faithful as we endeavor to make you known locally, across the U.S. and around the world. It's in your name we pray. Amen.",
