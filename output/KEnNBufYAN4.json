All right, everybody, we are 2 Kings chapter 16 tonight. So if you have your Bibles or if you want to pull up your digital Bibles on your phones, uh 2 Kings chapter 16. For those of you who are new to Wednesday night, we go straight through verse by verse. So this is a little more detailed and deeper than what we do on Sunday mornings. Uh this Sunday, we'll we'll be back in 2 Corinthians. Uh but for tonight here on Wednesday nights, we're in 2 Kings in your old testaments, and we have left off in the middle of chapter 16, 2 Kings chapter 16. So let me give us a running start so we can remember where we left off. Um the nation of Israel at this time is a divided nation. There's a king in the north, uh, the capital city of is Samaria, and the northern part of the nation is known as Israel, and then the southern part of the nation is known as Judah. There's a king who rules in Judah, and that capital city is Jerusalem. Sometimes the north and the south get into battles with each other, and one of those occasions is here in 2 Kings chapter 16. The king in the southern kingdom of Judah is a guy by the name of Ahaz. And Ahaz is being attacked by his uh brother to the north, the king of Israel at that time is Pikah, and also the king of the north has joined forces with the king of Syria. His name is Rezin, and those two are coming against the southern kingdom of Judah. So this king of the south is Ahaz, and he is a very wicked king. In fact, up to this point, he is the most wicked of the kings of Judah. How wicked is he? Look at this verse, just to remember from last week. This is 2 Kings 16, verse 3. It says, But King Ahaz walked in the way of the kings of Israel. That means the sinners, because the kings of Israel were all wicked. Indeed, he made his son pass through the fire according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel. And so what this verse tells us is that Ahaz practiced child sacrifice, that he sacrificed his own son. In 2 Chronicles chapter 28, when it retells this story, it says children plural. Here in 2 Kings 16, it says his son singular. So we know that the Bible doesn't contradict itself. So in 2 Kings 16, it's only reporting one child, but in 2 Chronicles 28, it says children plural. This is not limited to one child. This means he worshipped Molech. Molech was the god of the Canaanites, and they uh worshipped Molech as half bull and half man. It had the head of a bull and the body of a man, and they made this uh brazen image, this life-size hollowed out brazen image, and in the hollow of this image, they would build a fire and heat it like a furnace, so that this image of Molech was red hot, and then they would lay, as this picture portrays, as it illustrates, they would lay children on the arms of Molech and sacrifice to him. That's the king of the south. That's Ahaz. So God has allowed the king of the north and the king of Syria to come against Ahaz to discipline him for his idolatry, for his child sacrifice, for his for this is infanticide, this is murder. And so he is leading the people of Judah into idolatry of the worst kind. Well, Ahaz, seeing that he is outnumbered by the king of the north and the king of Syria, he hires the king of Assyria. Now, the king of Assyria, the Assyrian Empire at this time is growing to be the largest kingdom on the planet at this particular time. So you have, don't confuse Assyria with Syria. Syria is the capital city, Damascus, but Assyria encompassed what today on a map would be Iraq and part of Iran. Now the Assyrian Empire is gonna grow and it's gonna encompass parts of the Middle East, but for the moment, the king of Assyria, his name is Tiglaf Pilazer the third. And Ahaz says to Tiglath Pylizer the third, how about I give you some money and you help me fight the king Assyria and the king of Israel who are coming against me? And Tiglath Pileser sees this as an opportunity to line his pockets. He says, fine. Ahaz, what does he do? He strips the gold and the silver from the temple of God, and he gives it as payment, as tribute to the king of Assyria. And the king of Assyria fights for him. In fact, the king of Assyria kills the king of Syria. He kills him in verse 9. Uh, it says, So the king of Assyria heeded him, for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, carried its people captive to Kir and killed Rezin. That's the king of Syria. So now Ahaz, Ahaz is emboldened here. The king of Israel, Pekah, kind of backs off, and the king Ahaz goes to meet Tiglath Palezer in the capital city of Syria in Damascus, because now Assyria has taken over Syria. And he goes up to Damascus, and King Ahaz of Judah sees this altar that Tiglath Pileser is worshiping to his false gods from. And what does King Ahaz do? He gets out his iPhone, he starts taking a picture of this altar there in Damascus. And he's like, I like this. I like this altar. I want this same kind of altar back home in my temple to the Lord. I'm gonna put this kind of altar in that temple. And he sends a blueprint to Uriah the priest. And Uriah the priest in Jerusalem takes what Ahaz gives him, and he fashions an altar. Now listen, this is this is makes no sense here. God has given Ahaz rest from his enemies. And what Ahaz ends up doing is worshiping the God of Assyria, who helped him to conquer the other kings who are coming against him. Like, can you not recognize that this was God's grace in the moment to give you respite from your enemies? And you're gonna worship foreign gods with a foreign altar in the temple of your God. This is exactly what he does. And so Ahaz comes back to Jerusalem, and there Uriah has this altar all set up, and Ahaz starts to move the other articles of the Lord out of the temple, and he has this altar in the house of God, and he starts to worship on this altar in the temple of the Lord his God. We talked last week about two principles from chapter 16. The first is in the middle of our sinful state, God inserts the hope of the Messiah, because Isaiah was a prophet during this time, and Isaiah chapter 7, when Isaiah is speaking to Ahaz, that's when he quotes this messianic prophecy from Isaiah 7:14. Behold the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and you will call him Emmanuel, God with us. It is this hope of the Messiah in the midst of this guy who's like sacrificing his children to Molech, and he's worshiping God on this foreign altar. I mean, all of this is craziness. God is so patient with him. The other principle we noted was Uriah obeyed the voice of King Ahaz instead of the voice of the Lord, and we need to beware of pastors and spiritual leaders who seek to please men rather than God. That's what Uriah did. He wanted to please Ahaz instead of pleasing God. He had no business building an altar, a pagan altar in the house of the Lord. He should have confronted Ahaz and said, I can't build this. This is a pagan altar. We're not going to defile the house of God. Instead, he just listens to Ahaz. He does what Ahaz says. He puts up this false uh uh altar in the temple of the Lord, and he sets an example for us. Remember, beware, pastors and spiritual leaders who are more wanting to please man than to please God. So this is where we left off. Uh, verse 17 says, and King Ahaz, this is 2 Kings 16, verse 17. And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the carts and removed the labors from them, and he took down the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stones. Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion, which they had built in the temple, and he removed the king's outer entrance from the house of the Lord on account of the king of Assyria. So pause for a moment. He's dismantling the elements and articles of the house of God. And when it says here on account of the king of Assyria, another way of saying it is in deference to the king of Assyria, because now he's a vassal to the king of Assyria. He's paid this king off, he's given him tribute. He now is a subject to the king of Assyria. And the people of Judah are going to be taxed by the Assyrian king. They are going to be subjects of the Assyrian Empire, at least for a time here. It's going to get even worse for the northern kingdom. But this is why he's doing all this. He's like, well, you know, I paid off the king of Assyria, so now when he comes here to visit me, I want him to be able to see the same altar and not be offended by these other symbols here. And I'm even going to close off the entrance that I usually take for the kings, because I want to, you know, consider him. So this guy is completely gone woke, and then, and then he's hanging flags out in front of the temple. He's doing all kinds of things. And verse 19, then it says, Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? So Ahaz rested with his fathers, okay, he died, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and then Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his place. Now we're gonna read a little bit about Hezekiah, but uh please note, Hezekiah is a good king, which gives us hope that you know, you might have come from a family that is not that godly, but you can make a decision to be godly. And Hezekiah did not come from a godly family, but he chose to be godly. We'll read about him in a minute, but here's what we do normally when we're reading through kings. It goes back and forth between a king of the south, king of the north, king of the south, king of the north. So here we go into chapter 17. It says, in the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah in the south. They want us to know now, God wants us to know about Hashiah in the north, the son of Elah. He became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years. Now, now listen, he's gonna be the last king of the northern kingdom. And you'll see why. He did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as the kings of Israel who were before him. Shamanesar, king of Assyria, came up against him. Okay, now Tiglath Pylezer the third. This is Shamanizer, now another king of Assyria, believed to be the son of Tiglath Pylieser the third. So this is Shalmaneser and Eishaminezer the fifth. Don't ask me how they get the numbers, because that didn't make sense. You were born to a third, and now you're a fifth, and you don't even have his name. But anyway, here we go. Shamanesar, king of Assyria came up against him, and Hashiah became his vassal. You see, so now that in the king in the north, he's like, Okay, I gotta pay you tribute, because I want you to be my friend, I don't want you to kill us. And he paid him tribute money. Verse 4, and the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hashiah, for he had sent messengers to so, king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison. What was Hashiah doing? He sent a message down to the king of Egypt, whose name was So, you might ask, so what? I'm just saying, that's his name. I don't know what his last name was. So what? No, it's just so. So the king of Egypt, so makes this alliance with Hashiah, like you don't like the king of Assyria. Okay, I'll be your friend. Let's let's work together here. Well, Shamaneser uncovers the plot. So he's like, Hashiah, you're you're in jail now. So he locks him up in prison, he bounds him in prison. It says in verse five, now the king of Assyria went throughout all the land and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years. For you know takers, those years are roughly 725 to 72 BC. 725 to 722 BC. And he's besieging this the northern kingdom. In the ninth year of Hashiah, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. Okay, now understand what's happening here. The king of Assyria is not content just for the northern kingdom of Israel to pay him tribute money. He wants the land and he wants the people, so he's conquering it now. And he besieged it over a period of three years. And he finally conquers it in 723, 722 BC, and he carries away many of the Israelis in the north. What Assyria typically does, and they are known for this historically, they would, when they were there would capture territory, they would take the um wisest and wealthiest and strongest, and they would leave the poorest in the land, and they would take captive the wisest and the strongest, and they would take them to the land of Assyria, and then they would take some Assyrians and they would bring them into the land that they conquered to kind of repatriotize the land with the flavor of Assyria. So they don't only take you captive to their place, they take their own Assyrian people and bring them into your place, so that they can begin to conquer the land like that. And notice why. From verse 7 on, it's gonna give us an historical record. Why did God allow this? Why did God allow the Assyrian Empire to come and to conquer the northern kingdom of Israel? And so there's a record here of their history. And we're gonna notice here in verse 7, it starts out going all the way back to their captivity in Egypt. So I want you to note with me, they're going back to about 1450 BC. The siege of Israel takes place around 722 BC. So we're talking about 725 years of history, we're about to read here. Now I'm gonna point this out for a reason, but just read it with me for just a minute. Verse 7. For so it was. Here's the reason. For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and they had feared other gods, and had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel and of the kings of Israel, which they had made. Also the children of Israel secretly did against the Lord their God, things that were not right. And they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city. They set up for themselves sacred pillars and wooden images. Now these are idols, okay? They are foreign sacred objects. And we talked about how these wooden images were sexual images. These were phallic symbols that they had put up across the landscape in the worship of these Canaanite and Sidonian and uh all these other foreign gods around them. These were most of them were very sexualized images, and they're they're worshiping in this way. It says in verse 10 on every high hill and on every green, under every green tree. And there they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom the Lord had carried away before them, and they did wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger, for they served idols, of which the Lord had said to them, You shall not do this thing. Yet the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah by all of his prophets, every seer, saying, Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants, the prophets. Notice how God's going after them, trying to get them to see the light and to obey the truth. Nevertheless, verse 14, they would not hear, but stiffened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who did not believe in the Lord their God. Now, stiffened their necks, that is uh an expression of stubborn oxen. You know, when oxen would be harnessed to a yoke, so that they could be used to plow. If the ox, when the oxen got all stubborn, they would stiffen their necks and they wouldn't, they wouldn't be able to be easily harnessed. That's the idea here. God is saying, You became rebellious and stiff-necked like stubborn oxen. You would not submit to me. You would not surrender to me, just like your fathers before you. Verse 15, and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he had made with their fathers and his testimonies, which he had testified against them. They followed idols. They became idolaters, and went after the nations who were all around them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them that they should not do like them. And so they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, made for themselves a molden image and two calves, and made a wooden image and worshipped all the host of heaven and served Baal, that's the Canaanite God, and they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire. That's the worship of Molech, it's child sacrifice. They practiced witchcraft and soothsaying, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger. And therefore, the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah alone. Okay, so here's why I mentioned that this historical account goes all the way back to 1450 BC, when they had been delivered by the Hand of God from slavery in Egypt to the promised land all the way up to the current time. So seventh and 1450 BC to 722 BC. We're talking roughly 725 years or so. And God recounts their history because here's here's the deal. It's like, how long does God have to be patient with us? He was patient for 725 years, from the time he brought them out of Egypt until the time that he allows the Assyrians to come as the rod of his discipline. And so God, this is the indictment against them, saying, You did this, you did this, you did this, you did this, you did this, you did this, you did that. And the worst kind, child sacrifice, the worship of idols, all this stuff. And in the middle of it, God says, and I sent you prophet after prophet after prophet. I sent you seers, I sent you people who were gonna deliver my message to you, so that you would hopefully turn to me. I even told you, don't worship these other gods of the nations around you, and yet you still did. So, in other words, is God not justified to do what he wants to do? You better believe it, and he's justified concerning us too. How patient does God need to be with us? How many times does he need to warn us about our own sin, time after time after time, before there will be consequences. There were consequences here for the northern tribes. This passage ended by saying, Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah alone. Now, some of your translations say, but the Jews alone. It's the first use of the word Jews in all of the Bible. The word Jew comes from the tribe of Judah. And because only Judah was left, that's why all the Israelis are known as Jews, because of the tribe of Judah. Now, it isn't that the ten tribes were completely lost. Couple of things to point out. One is, um, if you want to glance over just a few pages to the right to 2 Chronicles. In 2 Chronicles chapter 11, it tells us that there was a group of people who left the northern kingdom because of all of its idolatry and sin, and they migrated to the southern kingdom. In other words, some from the tribe of the north, tribes, the ten tribes of the north, migrated down to the south. So this is 2 Chronicles 11. I'm gonna read verses 13 through 16. 2 Chronicles 11, 13, and from all their territories, the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel in the north, took their stand with him, talking about the kings. For the Levites left their common lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem. For Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the Lord. And then he appointed for himself priests for the high places for the demons and for the calf idols which he had made. And after the Levites left, those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers. So back here in 2 Kings 17. The reason I bring that those verses up is to let us know that it's not even that God had completely abandoned the people talk about the lost ten tribes of Israel. They're not lost. Okay. They were displaced because God disciplined them, but even before they were displaced, what I just read there in 2 Chronicles 11 tells us that some from each of the ten tribes of the north had enough conviction to get out of dodge. We're gonna leave the north. This is all terrible idolatry, child sacrifice, and we're gonna go to the south, and we're gonna live among the tribe of Judah, and we're gonna worship the Lord in his temple. So God always has a remnant. And God has preserved, and God still knows where the tribes of Judah of Israel are today, because we see in in Ezekiel and we see in the book of Revelation. Remember, in the last days, God raises up 144,000 Jews as evangelists during the tribulation period, and the Bible says 144,000 are 12,000 from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. And people go around going, Well, the ten tribes have been lost since 722 BC. Not to God, God knows where they are, and God will raise them up, and God will once again gather them together, and we see them in the revelation, we see them in the millennial kingdom. So the tribes are not lost, but they are certainly displaced at this time. By the way, this was all prophetic also. You don't need to turn there, it'll I'll finish it before you can find the book of Amos. But in Amos, Amos was a prophet during this time too. Listen to what Amos says here, uh, chapter 4, verses 2 and 3. The Lord God has sworn by his holiness, behold the day shall come upon you when he will take you away with fish hooks and your posterity with fish hooks, you will go out through broken walls, each one straight ahead of her, and you will be cast into Harmon, says the Lord. By the way, Harmon is a city that's not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible, but we don't know where it is, but it's probably in Assyrian territory. But Amos is specific there. He says, You're gonna be led out with fish hooks. Do you know how the Assyrians would take their captives to Assyria? With fish hooks. They would hook them through their noses, and they would string them along like fish, and they would take them that way as captives. Amos was prophesying to the people in advance, you're disobeying God. You know what's gonna happen? You're gonna be taken, you and your children, fish hooks in your nose, and you're gonna be taken out through a broken wall, because the Assyrians besiege the city of Samaria, break down the city walls, and the people are taken captive right out through the opening of the walls. Listen, as we go through these chapters and look at different principles, here's one from chapter 17. God is patient with his mercy, but just with his judgment. God was patient for 725 years from the Exodus until he sent the Assyrians as the rod of his discipline. He was patient with them. But he said, Enough is enough. And when God judges, you better believe his judge, his judgment is just. So there's that little commentary saying, Hey, Judah's not perfect either, and Judah's gonna get their comeuppance also. It won't be until 586 BC, and it's gonna be not the Assyrians, it's gonna be the Babylonians then. But God's just like, you know, like, look, they're not perfect either. But but then verse 21, for he tore Israel, this is the north, from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nabat king, and then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord and made them commit a great sin. For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam, which he did, they did not depart from them until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants, the prophets, and so Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, as it is to this day. And so they gave up their land, and they are taken captive to Assyria. Now, the weakest and the poorest are left in the land of Israel. And so what happens here is uh, well, actually, here's a here's a principle before I'm read on. This is important. We cede ground to the enemy when we compromise. You know, they they've given up their land because they compromised in their walk with the Lord. And the land that they gave up was given to the enemy. And it's what happens in our lives spiritually. We we cede ground to the enemy when we live in compromise. And so be warned of that. This is a this is a principle for us. But here's what the king does. As I said, he's gonna bring people from Assyria into the land. This is verse 24. Uh, sorry, am I reading this right? 24. Yeah, verse 24. And then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, that's that same area, Kurah, uh, Kuta, Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharavame. These are con these are conquered areas of the Assyrians, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel, and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities. So this is what I was talking about, how they repatriotize the land with their own people. And it was so, verse 25, and it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there that they did not fear the Lord. Therefore, notice the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them. And so they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land, and therefore he, God, has sent lions among them, and indeed they are killing them, because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land. All right, now, here's here, so here's what's happening. The Assyrian people who come into the land of Samaria, the capital city of the north, they don't know about the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so they're not worshiping him. And what does God do? He sends lions to attack them. Now, what does this say? What this says is it's principle number three. God is sovereign over the land of Israel. He is not just about the people who were there. He is. But this is also his land, his territory, and he's sovereign over the land of Israel. This is why it grates me when people start talking about if Israel would just give up land for peace. It's God's land. And he is sovereign over the land, so much so that when these people come into the land with no regard for the God of the land, he sends lions to get their attention. And they had devour these people. They start attacking these people. And what do the people do? They cry out to the king of Assyria. They're like, you know, we don't know what to do. And look, it's all ritualistic to them. They talk about rituals here. They have no relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They just want to do what they have to do to appease the God who's sending lions. So they say to the king of Assyria, you need to send back one of those priests that you took captive and tell us, you know, what we're supposed to do, because we don't we don't know what we're supposed to do. And so verse 27 says, Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there. Let him go and dwell there and let him teach the rituals. Notice the rituals of the God of the land. And then one of the priests, whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the Lord. Okay, please note. These priests were negligent in their spiritual responsibility. This is why they were not properly warning the people, teaching the people, and turning the hearts of the people toward God. So therefore, these priests, these are, these are fake guys. They're not gonna lead the people. So this one, this priest comes, it's like rent a priest. It's like, why don't we rent a priest and have him come back to the land here and let him start telling people ritualistic ways of approaching God. They're not gonna help these people. They're just gonna lead them in these ritualistic worships, but it's not legitimate, and notice what happens. However, okay, so this priest comes back, and he's he's like, Well, this is what you need to do. But notice, verse 29. However, every nation continued to make gods of its own and put them in the shrines on the high places, which the Samaritans had made. Every nation in the cities where they dwelt. The men of Babylon made succoth benoth. Okay, these are all false gods. The men of Kuth made Nergal. The men of Hamath made Ashima, and the Aba Avites made Nibas and TikTok. Uh and uh, sorry, Tartak. And the Sephurites burned their children in the fire to Adramalek and Anamelech, the gods of Serevaim. And so, look at this. So they feared the Lord from every class they appointed for themselves, priests of the high places who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places. They feared the Lord, yet served their own gods according to the rituals of the nations among them whom they were carried away. So they're not devoted to the true and living God, not by a long shot. They're like, okay, priest, tell us what we need to do. Okay, well, here's a few ritualistic things. Okay, yeah, we got that, because we want to make sure the lion God doesn't come and attack us, you know. We want to make sure Lion King is like a peace, and because we don't want to be devoured, but we're still gonna have our own little gods over here, sacrifice our children and do all these other unspeakable things. So here's the principle that spoke to me. It's number four, and we'll close with this one. Don't just pay tribute to God on Sundays to appease the lion, but then live like the devil during the week. That's what this says to me. It's like, you know what? There are a lot of people who just want to check the box, they want to come to church, they want to do the ritualistic thing, because they don't want God to be mad at them. But are they really developing a relationship with him? Are they really surrendering their hearts and their lives to him? Or are they just leaving church on a Sunday and then living like the devil during the week? That's what these people are doing. They're checking the box, doing the ritualistic things to appease the God who sends the lions, but then they're living like the devil during the week. They're doing demonic things here. I mean, literally demonic things. You're sacrificing your children, you're worshiping these false gods. This is all demonically inspired. It's a challenge to us. I think in the modern church, there's a lot of people who are comfortable in the pews. I mean, you're the Wednesday night crowd, all right. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about people who aren't here. But there's a lot of people in a lot of churches who go just to check the box instead of checking their hearts. And coming to a surrendered place where they're like, Jesus, forgive me, save me, and help me to walk in obedience to you. It's the surrendered life. Being a Christ follower is a surrendered life to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. And I pray that we would be dedicated that way to him. Father, this is your word, and we thank you for your word. Lord, we pray that it would not be said of us that we only draw near to you in ritualistic ways, but that it would be said of us that we long to be with you, to walk with you, to live a surrendered life to Jesus as our Lord and Savior. May we take note from these people, how they didn't really love you or walk with you. They just wanted to be protected from your anger. But Lord, we pray that we would be people who long to be close to you, long to walk with you, long to live a life that is devoted to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. So thank you for your word tonight, Lord. Speak to our hearts, even as we leave here tonight, and we give you all the praise, all the glory, all the honor in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen and amen.",
