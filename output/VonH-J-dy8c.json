  "transcript": "God has given us his word that not only address the day-to-day issues, but there's a lot of prophecy in here. You know, sometimes when people talk about the end times and eschatology and the book of Revelation, all this, you know, they get scared. And I always like to remind them listen, God has told us of these things, not to scare us, but to prepare us. For tonight, if you want to go to the book of Ezekiel, we're going to be looking there tonight at Ezekiel chapter 38, because I think it's important for me as a pastor to always frame things, particularly as it relates to culture and our times and world events through the lens of the Bible. I'll never forget a saying that Martin Luther had once when he said that if you preach the, he's talking to pastors, if you preach the gospel in all aspects, with the exception of addressing the issues of your time, you are not preaching the gospel at all. And I've always been challenged by that because it's not, it's not, it's not that we only present Jesus, we do that. We present the gospel. We want people to get saved. We want people to know how to come to faith through Jesus Christ. Um, we want people to get saved and go to heaven, but it is also understanding how does the Bible address everyday things and the culture and how does the Bible address world events? So I think it's important. Um I I want, I want Christians and cornerstone people in particular, to be the most uh well-informed people, uh, walking this planet. And the reason we can be the most well informed is because God has given us his word that not only address the day-to-day issues, but there's a lot of prophecy in here. There's a lot of prophecy in the Bible as it relates to future events. We should be the most prepared people. We should be people who are, you know, sometimes when people talk about the end times and eschatology and the book of Revelation, all this, you know, they get scared. And I always like to remind them listen, God has told us of these things not to scare us, but to prepare us, not to scare us, but to prepare us. And I believe that what happened in uh June, June 21st in particular, but even before that, when Israel started bombing Iran, is setting up things for the end times that I think we're gonna see here in Ezekiel chapter 38. Okay, so with that, let's have a word of prayer, and then we'll dive into this. Father, we thank you for this time that we can be together in your house. I thank you for those who are here and those who are watching online. We pray now that you would uh meet us here, Lord. Uh speak to our hearts, help us to be prepared, not scared as we think about things and read things in your word that talk about future events and end times and prophecy. We we know you've given us these things because you want us to be equipped. You want us to be well informed, you want us to be ready. And uh, and so we thank you for your word tonight. I thank you for all those who are here or watching online. Bless this time now in your word. We pray these things in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen. Amen. So I know that I'm a little late to the game because I've been away, but um, these are still things that are unfolding in the Middle East, and it's these are things that will still affect, I think, world events. Here are a couple of headlines. This was uh Saturday, June the 21st. U.S. strikes three Iranian nuclear sites, Trump announces, taking out Fordo, Natans, and uh Isfahan. Um those were nuclear sites that I uh the Iranians had already been producing and enriched uranium to uh bomb the little Satan and the big Satan, right? That's what they were always proclaiming. I think it's something that we should take seriously when when people say, you know, we want to wipe Israel off the face of the earth, and we then want to come after uh the United States as well, and refer to us both as big Satan and Little Satan. I think you should just take that seriously. I have to assume that Israel and the United States had hopefully legitimate, bona fide intel that they took action now. Because we and the Israelis have been saying this for decades, that Iran is close to a nuclear bomb, and now of all times, Israel took action, and then the United States took action. I have to believe that they were really on the verge to seriously carry out this threat. So the United States, thanks to our wonderful United States military serving our country, took out these three nuclear sites, and people started saying, Oh, world peace now. Um I'm on a thread with uh uh several pastors around the country, and they started saying things like, you know, Trump has now ushered in an opportunity for there to be peace in the Middle East. Look, I I'm I'm a Trump supporter, I've been unashamed about saying that, but I don't believe that what happened is gonna usher in world peace. Why do I say that? I texted my friends and my pastor friends on this thread, and I said, because Ezekiel 38 hasn't been fulfilled yet. And Ezekiel 38 tells us that Persia, which is Iran, rearms themselves and comes after Israel. And who do they link arms with but Russia? So whatever has happened in terms of our bombing the nuclear sites in Iran is temporary peace at best, because Iran emerges again. The Bible tells us this. So we should be prepared and realize this is not ushering in world peace. This is putting a band-aid on a problem that is not gonna go away because we know how it all works out according to scripture. So the very next day after the United States takes out these three nuclear sites, here's the next headline on Sunday, June the 22nd. Russian leader claims multiple countries prepped to provide Iran nuclear weapons following U.S. strikes. Fox News reported. And so here's what some of the article says. Russia's former president said that multiple countries are poised to provide Iran with nuclear warheads after the United States launched strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities. Quote, the enrichment of nuclear material, and now we can say it outright, the future production of nuclear weapons will continue, end quote. Dmitry Medvedev said now the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia said in a Sunday X post. Quote, a number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads, Medvedev said. So it's like this this is not going away. This is the next day after we took out the nuclear facilities. Let me read just another paragraph from the same article. It's not on the slide. Medvedev did not list specific countries that might pitch in and support Iran. However, Russia historically has backed Iran's nuclear program. Russian President Vladimir Putin also offered to mediate peace talks between Iran and Israel. Isn't that rich? Putin's like, I will mediate between Israel and Iran. I don't think so. That ain't gonna work. Moscow, according to the article, Moscow also has offered to intervene and help negotiate a nuclear deal between the US and Iran. Are you kidding me? Moscow was involved in the 2015 Iran deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action. The agreement lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program, but Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018. And I think you should have. So it's like, have we actually ushered in peace, or have we encouraged Russia and Iran to come together in a stronger deal? So Medvedev there is vague about what other countries are ready to help supply Iran with their nuclear weaponry. But uh the Bible's not vague about it. The Bible tells us here in Ezekiel chapter 38. So I'm gonna read the first 17 verses if you have your Bible open there to Ezekiel 38, verses 1 to 17. This is prophecy, friends. What we're reading here in Ezekiel 38 is prophecy. Ezekiel writes this. He says, Now the word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man, set your face against Gog. You can circle Gog and the land of Magog. You can circle or underline that. The prince of Rosh, Meshach and Tubal, and prophesy against him, and say, Thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshach and Tubal. I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out with all your army, horses and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and Shields, all of them handling swords. Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet. Gomer and all its troops, the house of Tagarma from the far north and all its troops, many people are with you. And then verse 17 to verse 13, this is all directed to Gog, who is prince over Magog. Verse 7. Prepare yourself and be ready, you and all your companies that are gathered about you, and be a guard for them. After many days you will be visited. In the latter years, you will come into the land of those brought back from the sword, that's the Jews, and gathered from many people on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely. You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you. Thus says the Lord God. On that day it shall come to pass that thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will make an evil plan. You will say, I will go up against a land of unwalled villages. I will go to a peaceful people who dwell safely. Notice that. All of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates, to take plunder and to take booty to stretch but your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered from the nations who have acquired livestock and goods who dwell in the midst of the land. Sheba, Dadan, and merchants of Tarshish, you can underline those. And all their young lions will say to you, Have you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty to carry away silver and gold to take away livestock and goods to take great plunder? Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, thus says the Lord God, on that day when my people Israel dwell safely. Now notice that. This is gonna happen at a time when Israel is dwelling in relative safety. Will you not know it? And then you will come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army. You will come up against my people, Israel, like a cloud to cover the land. It will be in the latter days that I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am hollowed in you, O Gog, before their eyes. Thus says the Lord, God, are you he of whom I have spoken in former days by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them. And so here we have these nations that are listed. Um I want to draw your attention back to the first two verses. Ezekiel names six nations that will converge against Israel. This is not the Battle of Armageddon, friends. Now, these are events, this is a coalition of nations that are coming together against Israel that will eventually turn into the battle of Armageddon. But Ezekiel 38 itself is not Armageddon. This is kind of what we call pre-armagedon. This is a military campaign against Israel that may very likely last the entire seven years of the tribulation. It appears that this battle that is forming here in Ezekiel 38 is in reference to nations that come together at the beginning of the tribulation period. The campaign itself may last a full seven years and culminate in the Battle of Armageddon, but this itself in Ezekiel 38 is not Armageddon. Uh, it is leading to that. And there are six nations that are mentioned here by name that come together that converge against Israel, including and led by Russia. Now, this is the first two verses. Now the word of the Lord came to me saying, Son of man, set your face against Gog. All right, now I ask you to circle that word in the Bible because that is a person. That's not a country or a city. That is a title of an individual. It can be translated prince, or because of the context here, it could also be translated Tsar. This is someone who is the leader of Russia. You notice the description of the land, it is the land of Magog, the land, and he is called the prince of Rosh. So right there it sounds obvious, Russia, Rosh, the prince of Rosh, and then Meshach and Tubal. So all of this, Magog, Meshach, Tubal, all make up Rosh. And what are these various towns? Well, if you're taking notes, Magog was described by Josephus, the ancient historian, Pliny, Herodotus, these are all ancient historians. They all said that Magog was the land of the ancient Scythians. The land of the ancient Scythians was north of the Black and Caspian seas. So this is Russia. This is the land of Russia. It's the land of the ancient Scythians. Meshach, listed there, is thought to be modern Moscow, and to Baal that is mentioned there is a reference to Tabolsk, Tabalsk is the West Central Russia. It used to be the Siberian oil capital. So all of this describes Russia. All these different terms describe Russia. Gog describes the prince or the czar of Russia, and he's going to lead this coalition of nations against Israel. And so God has a word for Gog and for this campaign that he is leading here. So that's the first of six nations. And joining Russia in this confederation are five other nations. And the first on the list, if you look again, I'll just put on the screen, verse five, is Persia, because uh Ezekiel says here, he prophesies, he says, Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them. Well, Iran was called Persia until 1935. We know exactly the territory that this is describing. Uh the the nation on the top of the list that joins Russia in this campaign against Israel is Iran. So don't think that Iran is done. Don't think Iran is finished. Don't think that they they, you know, they're out of the game here. They've just been temporarily wounded, and they're gonna have other nations that come alongside of them. Russia's already said they will, and help re-arm them with the same technology and ability and weaponry that we just destroyed. So uh we're not done. This is a temporary respite, uh, but we haven't heard the last of Iran. Also on this list here in verse five is Ethiopia. Uh, sorry. Um, oh, yeah, I wanted to share this with you before we move to Ethiopia, because here's an example in uh modern news about the partnership that Russia and Iran have. They sign a partnership treaty to deepen their ties in the face of Western sanctions. This is an AP story that ran in January of this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Massood uh Pezeshkin signed a broad cooperation pact Friday. This is back in January of 25, as their countries deepened their partnership in the face of stinging Western sanctions. Russian and Iranian officials say the comprehensive strategic partnership treaty covers all areas from trade and military cooperation to science, education, and culture. The 20-year treaty could be extended further. Putin praised the deal as quote, a real breakthrough, creating conditions for the stable and sustainable development of Russia, Iran, and the entire region. So this is already happening. And um, they are um they're their friends now. You know, a few years ago, Russia delivered its advanced S-300 missile defense system to Iran after years of debate over the purchase and warnings from the United States. Russia still delivered all this technology. Five years ago, Russia and Iran negotiated a 10 billion dollar arms deal, allowing Iran to purchase T-90 tanks, artillery systems, and aircraft from Moscow that are expected to keep the Islamic Republic fully armed over the next several years. So they they're not, they're not done, they're just wounded. Now, look, the I personally believe that the Iran deal of 2015 was a terrible deal, and I think it was a necessary thing that we get out of it, and uh especially for the sake of Israel. And I personally, this is this is again me personally speaking. I think personally bombing Iran's nuclear sites was also a necessary thing. But let me tell you what the unintended consequences are for both of those, that when we withdraw from that, which again I think was a good thing, and when we take out temporarily Iran's nuclear capabilities, the unintended consequences is it pushes Iran into the arms of Russia. And that I mean that figuratively, and I mean that literally, because they form this partnership like a big hug, so they come into each other's arms. They're they're friends now. They're they're and this is the first time. You have to understand, we have not seen this kind of a partnership between Russia and Iran or Persia, uh, except in the last like 20 years. For 2500 years, I mean, it just didn't exist, Russia and Iran. Only in the last 20 years. We're seeing Bible prophecy being fulfilled in our lifetime. Only in the last 20 years have these two nations formed a partnership and a coalition where they are exchanging technology and um and they're cooperating on this level of military armament and science and education, all this kind of stuff. So they've come together. And I think an unintended consequence of bombing the nuclear sites, which again, I think was a necessary thing, has driven Iran and Russia closer together to set up what we read here in Ezekiel 38. That's all I'm saying. And so seeing all of this coming together, there was a trilateral summit in Jerusalem in 2019 between the US and Israel and Russia, with the intent of, you know, trying to figure out relations between these different nations. Benjamin Netanyahu, in that summit in 2019, he realized that Iran and Russia are becoming too cozy, and in an effort to try to distance those two nations, Netanyahu said this in 2019. He said, quote, Israel will not allow Iran, which calls for our destruction, which is true, to establish itself on our border, and we'll do all we can to prevent it from getting a nuclear weapon. Okay, that was 2019. So he made good on his promise here in 2025 by engaging in war with Iran, and then the US comes along and assists with the it's so hard to say, but the bunker busting bombs. And that's what they and that's what we do to assist Israel. But joining the Russian Iranian alliance is now I can go to the next slide that I gave you a preview of is Ethiopia. That's next in the list. Ethiopia, some of your Bibles say Kush, that's the Hebrew word for Ethiopia. Um Ethiopia is 45% Sunni Muslim population, according to the US State Department. And the description of Cush, ancient and ancient times, would also include on a modern map, uh, Northern Sudan. Northern Sudan is 70% Sunni Muslim. And then also in the list here are Libya. Uh Libya, some of your translations say put, that's also Hebrew for Libya. It's 97% Sunni Muslim. And so what we see here between Iran, Ethiopia, and Libya, this represents here the Islamic states of the upper Nile region of Africa. We're talking Ethiopia and Libya, not Iran, but Ethiopia and Libya represent the Islamic states, uh, and including Northern Sudan of the upper Nile region of Africa. So back here to verse um five. No, we're actually in verse six. If you look at verse six, he lists um, in addition, other countries here. I have verse five in the screen, but I think that is uh my own misprint. It is verse six. Verse six, Gomer and all its troops, the house of Tagarma from the north and all its troops, many people are with you. So we have Russia, we have Iran, we have Ethiopia, we have Libya, those are four, and then here are the two others, Gomer and Tugarma. Now, if you grew up watching Andy Griffith, get Gomer out of your head, because that's not the Gomer here. Now I just put it in your head if it wasn't there before. But Gomer is an ancient reference to Eastern Europe, it's the area of Germany and Poland, and to Garma is a reference to the area of Turkey, primarily Turkey, but it could also include Armenia and Georgia. So these are the six nations Russia, Iran, Ethiopia, Libya, um, the area of Germany slash Poland, because in ancient times they didn't have the same borders, obviously as they do now. So and then to Garma, the area of Turkey, um, which might include Armenia and Georgia, but these six are listed here, and God tells us they are going to engage in this military campaign and form this coalition and come against Israel. So we've not heard, as I said now several times, we've not heard the last of Iran. Do not think that this is a permanent peace. This is a temporary um temporary uh victory over the imminent threat of um nuclear war, uh, but um this is this is not gonna be lasting, I'm I'm afraid to say, because this is what the Bible tells us. I'm just telling you what the Bible tells us. But here in Ezekiel 38, if you notice with me when we were reading through it, there will be nations, there will be a few who question why these nations are coming against Israel. And it's verse 13, and I'll just put the verse on the screen or you can underline it in your Bibles. This is what um Ezekiel also says. Sheba and Dadan, the merchants of Tarshish and all their young lions will say to you, say to Gog, the prince of Russia, have you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty? I mean, this is New King James, so don't let that word distract you, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder. So there are a few nations that come against um this coalition, at least in terms of questioning. Why are you doing this? Why are you guys going against Israel? And who are these nations? Who is Sheba and Dadan are both territories that on a map today is Saudi Arabia? Now that's interesting. Saudi Arabia, why would they question nations that are coming against Israel? I mean, there's there's a there's somewhat peaceful relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia, they're they're Muslim. Um the Jews, you know, this is this is people think Middle Eastern war is about nations. It's not, it's about religion. It's Islam versus Judaism. And the uh Saudi Arabians right now are cordial towards Israel. I'm wondering, this is just pure speculation. I'm wondering if at some point Saudi Arabia joins the Abraham Accords. And because they have friendly relationships with a friendly relationship with Israel, perhaps by joining the Abraham Accords in the days to come, that they will, that's the reason why they will question. It's not like they come to Israel's defense, but they at least are like, you know, I'm not sure this is a good idea, Russia and and Iran. So they question Sheba and Dadan at Saudi Arabia. And then another uh country that questions uh is Tarshish. Now, the the historian from the fifth century, Herodotus, Herodotus said that Tarshish, he wrote about Tarshish, and he said that Tarshish was located beyond what he called, quote, the pillars of Hercules. What are the pillars of Hercules? The pillars of Hercules are the rock formations at the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. We know it today is the Strait of Gibraltar. And so Herodotus in the fifth century said that Tarshish was beyond the Strait of Gibraltar and leaving the Mediterranean Sea into the Atlantic. So a lot of Bible scholars believe that Tarshish is a reference to England, that England will also question this coalition that is formed against Israel. And it's interesting because it talks about the merchants of Tarshish in this verse and her quote young lions. What is the national symbol for England? It's a lion. British territories. And I think what's interesting is that, you know, we just got through celebrating our independence on July the 4th. But, you know, America used to be a British colony. We used to be a part of the British Empire, if you will. And this verse here, Ezekiel 38, 13, if anyone wonders, where's the United States in in prophecy? And I get that question often. I point to this as saying this might be the only veiled reference to the United States. We can't even be certain of this. This might be the only veiled reference because the United States is missing from Bible prophecy. And so as a former British colony, some scholars believe that the young lions of Tarshish is a reference to the United States. And that think about this. Depends on what numbers you read, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 billion Christians on the planet today. Now I personally think that number is greatly exaggerated. That that's just basically people who identify themselves as neither Jewish nor Muslim nor Hindu. Like they've eliminated all the other world religions, and they're like, I'm Christian. Okay, so there's a lot of that in that 2.1 billion number. But but let's just reduce that and say, even if half, even if half are genuine followers of Christ, okay, that that even still might be generous. I don't know. I don't know what the number is. Only God knows what that number is. But you know, you're talking about a billion people who are gonna get raptured and will leave the planet. And how many of that billion are in the United States? I mean, the United States per capita uh has a lot of Christians. We you know, we have been the mission sending country of the world. So if the United States has lost by virtue of the rapture, um, tens of thousands of Christians, is it possible that the United States is rendered kind of um powerless during this time, and that's why they question, but they don't come to the aid of Israel, neither does Saudi Arabia. They're just questioning all of this. It's interesting too. Who else is missing? Other players are missing from this from this chapter. Egypt is missing, Jordan is missing, Syria. No reference to these other countries. Egypt since 1979 has had a peace treaty with Israel, which got them kicked out of the Arab League, by the way. And then they were reinstated in 1989. Jordan, since 1994, Jordan has had a peace treaty with Israel. Syria, Syria may already be rendered ineffective. Isaiah 17, 1 pronounces judgment and says, Damascus will cease from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap. So Damascus and Syria might actually be a heap of ruin by the time we get here to this battle of Ezekiel 38. So Saudi Arabia, England, perhaps, the United States, perhaps, will question why these nations are converging against Israel, but none will intervene. None will come to Israel's aid. And you know what? It's okay, because there is one who will, the Lord Himself. He will come to Israel's defense. The Bible says in Psalm 121, verse 4 indeed he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. And all of this culminates, as I said, to the battle of Armageddon, fueled by anti-Semitism and inspired by demonic principalities. We are seeing a rise of anti-Semitism like never before. And so all of this is going to be an effort, an attempt, you know, demonically inspired to thwart the redemptive plan of God. Nations will descend upon Israel. But God will step in. God will step in and he will intervene while the other nations remain silent. God shows up in a powerful way. If you have your Bible still there at Ezekiel 38, look at verses 18 to 23. Look at look at the rest of the chapter. Verse 18. And it will come to pass. Now I want you to notice this language as I read it. I'm going to highlight a few words, because the judgment part, there are several words that are very similar to the battle of Armageddon in Revelation chapter 16. And I'll compare the two with you in the remaining couple minutes we have. But notice with me here, verse 18, and it will come to pass at the same time, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord God, that my fury will show in my face. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath, circle wrath. I have spoken. Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake, underline that, in the land of Israel, so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth shall shake at my presence. And then it says, the mountains shall be thrown down. Notice that. The steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. I will call for a sword against Gog throughout all my mountains, says the Lord God. Every man's sword will be against his brother, and I will bring him to judgment with pestilence. Notice that. And bloodshed. I will rain down on him on his troops and on the many peoples who are with him, flooding rain, great hailstones. Notice that. Fire and brimstone. Thus I will magnify myself and sanctify myself, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and then they shall know that I am the Lord. If you'll leave Ezekiel now and go to Revelation chapter 16, we're just going to close by by seeing here this uh comparison between what we just read there at the end of Ezekiel 38 and what we're gonna read here in Revelation chapter 16, because I want you to see how this military campaign probably is a seven-year campaign culminating in the battle of Armageddon. Other nations join in, and then God comes, judges these nations, and ends the battle once for all. This is Revelation 16. I'll read verse 16 to 21. And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew Armageddon, or Hebrew, it's harmagido. And then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings, and there was a great earthquake. Remember reading that? Such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. Now the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Remember all that? And great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. Remember, I asked you to circle that word. And then every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. That phrase was also in Ezekiel 38. And great hail from heaven fell upon men. Each hailstone about the weight of a talent. That's a hundred pounds, friends. Talking about doing damage to your car, you better call your insurance company now. Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, since that plague was exceedingly great. So very similar terminology to what we read in Ezekiel 38. And also here in Revelation 16 in verse 12, it says, the kings of the East will join with these nations of Ezekiel 38 for this climactic world war against Israel, which is really a battle against God. The kings of the East will include China, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, the whole Pacific Rim. They will join these other nations and come against Israel in the end of the days. But the Lord returns, and he steps in to defend Israel and his name. Jump over to Revelation 19. Revelation 19. I'll read verses 11 to 16. Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed him on white horses. That's the saints, friends, those who have been raptured or who have predeceased this event, who know Christ, they come back with him on white horses. Now out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations, and he himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He himself treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God, and he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Can I hear an amen? And Jesus strikes down the nations who have come to make war and displays his power and glory for all to see. Now you don't need to flip back to Ezekiel 38, but let me just quote again the last verse of Ezekiel 38, because it has to do with what we read here in Revelation, where God returns. Jesus returns on a white horse. But the last verse of Ezekiel 38, verse 23, says, Thus I will magnify myself and sanctify myself, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, then they shall know that I am the Lord. They shall know that I am the Lord. So here is our reminder from Luke 21, 28. Jesus says, Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near. Amen. Amen. So we know how it all ends, friends. Keep looking up. Our Savior is coming again. Father, we thank you for your word tonight, that you have given us these things in advance, so we should be aware and prepared. And uh, Lord, however long this temporary peace in the Middle East will be experienced, uh, we know it won't be forever because of what we just read. And so, Lord, we should always be mindful that you're coming again, that uh there are nations that hate Israel, hate the Jewish people, and will come against uh the Jewish people and the nation of Israel, but that Lord, you will intervene, and you will put an end to the war of all wars, and you will come victoriously riding on a white horse as the King of kings and Lord of Lords. So we thank you, Lord, for that, that our blessed hope is in you, and that we will be taken out of here. We will be raptured, probably before the events or right around the time of Ezekiel 38, so that we can be safely with you in heaven, and we can um return with you on white horses to serve you, Lord. And so we thank you for the hope we have in Jesus. And as we leave here tonight, may we always be mindful of that, that no matter what happens in our world, that you're on the throne and you are coming again. May you find us ready. In Jesus' name we pray. And everybody said, Amen and amen.",
