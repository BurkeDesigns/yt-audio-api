  "transcript": "If you are going through a difficult season of life right now, God desires to bind your heart to his. God desires that you know more of who he is in your life. And that happens through this binding, this twisting, this molding, melding of your heart with his. So that you're one with the heart of God. That's what God desires to reveal to you in time of trouble. Psalm 27, would you stand with me now, church, as we read God's word together. I'm gonna ask that if you are able that you would stand and let's honor God's word together in this way. I'm gonna read all of Psalm 27. It's only 14 verses. Would you follow along with me as I read out loud? Psalm 27, verse 1, it says, The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh, my enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an army may encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war may rise against me, in this I will be confident. One thing I've desired of the Lord, that will I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, everybody say trouble. He shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle. He shall hide me. He shall set me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tabernacle. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice, have mercy also upon me and answer me. When you said, seek my face, my heart said to you, your face, Lord, I will seek. Do not hide your face from me. Do not turn your servant away in anger. You've been my help. Do not leave me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take care of me. Teach me your way, O Lord. Lead me in a smooth path because of my enemies. Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen against me, and such as breathe out violence. I would have lost heart unless I had believed that I'd see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Verse 14. Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart. Wait, I say on the Lord. The title of our Bible study is When in Times of Trouble. Would you pray one more time with me? Heavenly Father, we invite you into our Bible study. Open up our ears to hear from you. We love you in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated, church. When in times of trouble. Psalm 27 is a psalm written by David. And in Psalm 27, David is going to address two different forms of conflict in his life. He's gonna he's gonna first address the external conflict he's experiencing, and then he's also going to address some internal conflict within his own family. Now, in verse 5, he says, For in the time of trouble, for in the time of trouble. So it's clear that David is experiencing some kind of trouble in his life. What trouble is that? Well, we're not sure because he doesn't specify. All throughout his life, David was experiencing different forms of difficulty or challenges or trouble. You see, before David, after David was anointed king, before he took the throne, you know, he was anointed king, roughly around the age of 15 years old, but it wouldn't be another 15 years till he was 30 years old, where he would be the king of the nation of Israel. And so this 15 years of waiting on the Lord. However, it wasn't just red roses, it was filled filled with much tragedy, gloom, and fear. You see, Saul, the first king of Israel, was jealous and envious of David that he was anointed to be the next king, and he often chased David down, seeking his life. David was on the run numerous times in his life, hiding in caves from King Saul. So could he be writing in that kind of a context? Absolutely. Could have been after he was king, though, because the Bible said David had many sons and daughters, and one of his sons, Absalom, Absalom started this revolt against his own father, so that Absalom could be on the throne of the nation of Israel. Absalom started this coup, he got many people around him, even David's own friend Ahithophel, uh abandoned David and went with his his son Absalom in this coup, in this revolt against the throne, and his son Absalom even seeked to kill his own dad David. So could David be writing in that context? Absolutely, we're just not sure. Regardless, David is experiencing some kind of trouble in his life. And again, he's going to address two different forms of conflict, external conflict around him, internal conflict within his own family. Glance down at a few verses with me, verse two. He says, When the wicked came against me, all right, this is external conflict around him to eat up my flesh, my enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell. Verse 3. Though an army may encamp against me, all right, jump down to verse 6. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me. So again, David is first addressing the external conflict he's experiencing around him, but then he transitions to internal conflict within his own relationships. Look at verse 10. He says, When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take care of me. Or your translation might say, the Lord will receive me. We don't exactly know what's going on in David's family life, but certainly it's safe to assume his mom and dad weren't the best. And so David is experiencing internal conflict within his own family, with his parents, with his mom and dad, who at some point in his life, David feels as though they they forsook him, and he says, But the Lord will take care of me. I don't necessarily know the trouble, the difficulty, the challenges that you brought into church this morning. We could sit here all day filling in the blank. You might be experiencing external conflict around you. Maybe that's conflict at work, conflict with your boss, conflict with your employer or your employees. You might be experiencing internal conflict within your own family. Maybe it has to do with your mom and dad. Maybe your your son, your daughter, your family, your siblings. Maybe the internal conflict is within your own marriage this morning. Maybe the internal conflict you're going through is the financial, financial trouble, financial issues, maybe it's health challenges. Maybe you're experiencing difficulty with your body physically. And so I simply pray that this Bible study in Psalm 27 would just be a source of encouragement to whatever trouble you're going through this morning. And so as we unpack this Psalm together, I have four things that I believe we can learn from this Psalm of David. And the very first thing, when in times of trouble is number one, have confidence in the Lord. Have confidence in the Lord. Glance down at verses one through three again with me. David again writes, The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh, my enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an army may encamp against me, my heart shall not fear, though war may rise against me, in this I will be confident. Everybody say confident. He says, In this I will be confident. In what? Well, in the reality of verse one. He says in verse one, the Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? He says, in this fact that God is the light of my life, that God is my salvation, that God is my strength. That gives me the confidence. Confidence in the Hebrew, it's the it's the Hebrew word batak, and it has the imagery of one throwing themselves down on the ground. Batak, to throw oneself down on the ground. And it has the idea then of trust. You are laying your life upon the Lord. Is everybody with me? You guys doing okay? You are laying your life upon the Lord. It invokes this idea of trust in the Lord, dependence on the Lord, this confidence, confide in the Latin, meaning by faith. To have this faith, this trust in the Lord, not just this wishful thinking, but this calm steadiness. It's confidence. Now, confidence not in yourself, not in your own strength, not in your situation, but confidence in the midst of conflict is possible because of who you know. I'll say it again. Confidence is possible in the midst of conflict because of who you know. And who you know is number one, he says, You are the light of my life. The Bible says in the New Testament that God dwells in unapproachable light. You need wisdom for your situation. God will give you wisdom when you call upon the Lord who is your light, because he gives you, he exposes your path so that you can walk on smooth ground. The Bible says, your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light. Unto my path. The word personified is Jesus Christ, John 1 1. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. So God is light. It's not only that He that light emanates from Him. No, He He is light. It's his very nature, His very being. He is light. The Lord is my salvation. Jesus, in the Hebrew, his name is Yahashua, really, Old Testament, it's Joshua, New Testament, it's it's Jesus. Because of as you transliterate the languages, you get Yesus and Jesus, and those of you who are Spanish speakers, Jesus, and so Jesus, Yahashua, Joshua, it means my salvation. The Lord is my salvation. Again, as you throw yourself upon the Lord, and sometimes that's literal, right? As you are going through difficult situations and you throw yourself upon the Lord in your closet, in your quiet time, in your bedroom, you throw yourself upon the Lord, you are what you are doing in essence is you are submitting your life to the Lord, saying, I am putting my confidence in you, Lord. And in the midst of trouble, you can you can carry that confidence in the Lord in the midst of conflict. Number two, when in times of trouble, trouble, pursue intimacy with the Lord. Pursue intimacy with the Lord. Glance down at verse 4. Verse 4, David says, one thing I've desired of the Lord, that will I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. Your translation might say, He will conceal me. In the secret place of his tabernacle, he shall hide me. He shall set me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me. Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tabernacle. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord. Check this out, verses seven and eight. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice, have mercy also upon me and answer me. Listen, when you said, now this is God speaking to the heart of David. When you said, seek my face, my heart said to you, your face, Lord, I will seek. The new living translation puts it this way. And my heart responds, Lord, I am coming. The call for the believer and the unbeliever is the same. God calls out to you today saying, Come, come. Oh, Austin, you don't know what I did last night. You don't know what I did last week, last month, last year. Oh, I don't need to know, but God knows. And the call for you is the same. Come. Jesus would say in the New Testament, for all who are heavy laden, I will give you rest. He says, Come, take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. God in the Old Testament, God in the New Testament, in the person of Jesus Christ. The call is the same. Come. Come, dirty sinner. And I will have mercy upon you. You have no idea. You have no idea unless you've experienced this first hand. When you come to the Lord in repentance, how much the Lord will lavish and pour out his spirit upon the broken repentant sinner. It's unbelievable. It will blow your mind. As you come to the Lord with this brokenness, and I'm not just talking about feeling sorry for your sins. I'm talking about feeling just this brokenness over your sin. God wants to draw you in. Jesus would say, remember when he would overlook Jerusalem, He'd say, Jerusalem, Jerusalem. How long to gather you together as a mother hand gathers your chicks, but you are not willing. Some of you have been resisting the call from the Lord to come for far too long. What are you waiting for? Come and experience the goodness of the Lord. Come and experience his forgiveness and his mercy upon your life. Come and experience the overwhelming power of the Holy Spirit as you come to him in faith. Come and experience how he will wash away your sins, make you as white as snow. Come and experience an overwhelming love and joy that you've never known before. You've tried popularity, you've tried substances, you've tried a paycheck, and it hasn't fulfilled the way you thought it would. But when you come to the loving arms of the Heavenly Father, He will pour out His love upon you like a good dad, huddles around his kids and brings them in and pulls them into His heart. And it'll pour out His presence upon you in such a new, fresh way, will overwhelm you. It'll overwhelm you. In the Old Testament in Exodus chapter 30, 31, 32, 33, Moses would be there on the mountain and he would cry out to God. He'd say, Show me your glory. Show me your glory. And the glory of the Lord was too intense for Moses, that God tells Moses, you can't see my face, but I'll allow you to see my back as I pass through the cleft of the rock. So God places Moses in the cleft of the rock and he passes by. And Moses was privy to see the small glimpse of God's glory. Are you that desperate to see God's glory this morning in the same way? Where you come before the Lord because he beckons you and he calls you to come. And you say, Show me more of yourself, Lord. See, you can do one of two things in your time of trouble. You can either pursue the Lord and press further into the Lord, or you can pull further away from the Lord. And sometimes I've done both in my life personally. And so and sometimes when we're in the midst of difficulty, we can do one of two things. We can pursue the Lord and meet with the Lord and ask the Lord for help, or we can pull further away from the Lord, because we correlate our difficulty with the heart of our Father. And we think that this difficulty is because of how God sees me, how God views me. Yes, certainly God allows difficulty, but it's never to push you further away, it's to pull you deeper in. And David says, he says this in verse 4, there's this one thing I've desired. This one thing I've desired of the Lord, and this I will seek. So seek, it's a verb. It means to pursue. You as the believer, you need to be intentional about pursuing the Lord. Now don't get it twisted. God's already initiated 100% of this relationship. All right, he pursued you the full hundred percent. God came in the form of man, Jesus Christ, died on the cross for our sins, rose from the dead, suffered in every way. The Bible says he was tempted in every way as we are, yet was without sin. So he was tempted, he was beaten and bruised, died on the cross, rose from the dead. God says, now simply the call for you is just to respond. I've done all the work, I came out pursued you the 100% of the way. Now you just respond to my call after your life. And that's why David says, This is one thing I seek. Because in this relationship, now it's a two-way street, or he desires that you participate in this relationship. He says that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me or conceal me in his pavilion in the secret place. He shall hide me. See how God so desires to draw you into deeper depths of intimacy and fellowship with him. And then in verse 8, he says, When you said, Seek my face, my heart responded, your face, O Lord, I will seek. You see, God wants the believer to seek his face above anything else. Sometimes we are so caught up in seeking God's hand rather than seeking God's face. All we want at times is for God to do his favors. We see him as a genie in a bottle who's here to serve our every whim. And we just want God to give us a handout when we're in trouble. Say, God, would you just, would you just get me out of this difficulty? Would you just, would you just pour your hand out of blessing upon me and save me from this trouble? And sometimes the Lord allows us to remain in trouble so that we seek his face and not just his hand. See, James in James chapter 1, he would say, Count on all joy, my brothers and sisters, when you remain in trials. For when you when you remain in those trials, it will develop patience or perseverance, and that patience when it's had its perfect work, you will be complete, lacking nothing. And that word patience in the Greek is hypo meno, menon meaning to remain in, and hoopo meaning under. God sometimes allows you to remain under trials, so that you press further into depths of intimacy with him, so that you seek his face and not just his hand, so that you seek the giver and not just the gifts. Is everybody understanding this? And so God says, Come, come. And David says, My heart responds, Lord, I am coming. Lord, I am coming. God wants more time with you. Oftentimes we're so distracted by the cares of the world. Does anybody else get that screen time notification? For me, I don't know if it's for everybody, for me, it's every Sunday morning. I will probably get a screen time notification while we are spending time together. And it will say something like, Austin, your scream time for the for the uh it tracks the day, sometimes the week. Your screen time for the day has been five hours. And I think, well, I might I had my white noise on while I was sleeping, so that was probably it. You know, making excuses. And this is an awesome tool, but it will destroy our lives if we let it, because what Satan does is he uses these kinds of fun toys and tools to keep us from time with the Lord, to distract us. And the simple call of God on your life today is just come and spend some time with me. Will you respond and say, Lord, I am coming? Number three, when in times of trouble, seek help from the Lord. Have confidence in the Lord, pursue intimacy with the Lord, and seek help from the Lord. Lord. Glance down at verses 9 through 13 with me. David says, Don't hide your face from me. Don't turn your servant away in anger. You've been my help. Do not leave me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will receive me. Some of you that that's very personal to you. Because you didn't grow up in that kind of a loving environment where you had a good dad or a good mom. And you need to hear this from God's word today, that the Lord sees you and not only sees you, but he receives you. The Lord will take care of you. The Bible says that he is a father to the fatherless. And so the Lord is there for you. And he says, Lord, you've been my help. Look at verse 11. He says, Teach me your way, lead me in a smooth path. So the Lord is not only a good dad, but he's a good teacher. He desires to teach us and instruct us through the pages of his word. He says in verse 12, do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen against me, as such as breathe out violence. I would have lost heart unless I believe that I'd see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. In your time of trouble, seek help from the Lord. Before you turn to anybody else, before you turn to a friend, before you turn to his spouse, before you turn to your family, seek the Lord. Now all of those can be good resources. But David says, Lord, you have been my help. Finally, point number four, when in times of trouble, don't forget to wait on the Lord. And if I had a favorite point, it'd be point number four of this list. Don't forget to wait on the Lord. And we'll close with this. Glance down at verse 14. He says, wait on the Lord. Everybody say, wait. He says, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord. Now there's a reason he mentions that word twice because he's trying to bring an extra amount of emphasis to this word wait. Now, our English ears hear the word wait as this passivity. Like, oh, I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting for something. And I'm I'm at the drive-through window and I'm I'm waiting and we're just we're just sitting by and there's this passivity to it, right? The Hebrew is much deeper, and our English word wait. In the Hebrew here, David uses the word kava. Kavah in the Hebrew. The very first time we see that Hebrew word kava mentioned, it's in the very first book, the very first chapter, Genesis chapter 1, verse 9. And Moses, when he wrote Genesis chapter 1, what is he doing? He is, he is outlining and describing the days of creation. And in Genesis chapter 1, verse 9, it says that God gathered and collected the waters of the uh uh uh God gathered together and collected the waters to form the sea. Now, where in the world is the word wait in Genesis 1 9? Well, when the Bible says that God gathered or collected the waters together, that word to gather is the same word kava. Now, how does how does to gather and to wait? How does that correlate? The word kava, it literally means to bind or to twist. And so in Genesis 1 9 is God is gathering or collecting the waters in Psalm 27, verse 14. What David is saying is God desires to bind, to gather to twist your heart to his. That word kava, it gives the imagery of twisting together a rope. You see, a rope is made of many strands, twisted and pulled and tied together. And within that, there is greater strength. And within strength, there is this relying upon, this waiting upon. That rope now is able to hold your weight. So as you wait upon the strength of that rope, again, it's this idea of this gathering, this twisting, this binding together. If you are going through a difficult season of life right now, God desires to bind your heart to his. God desires that you know more of who he is in your life. And that happens through this binding, this twisting, this molding, melding of your heart with his. So that you're one with the heart of God. That's what God desires to reveal to you in time of trouble. A year and a half ago, I I ruptured my Achilles tendon on my left leg and um surgically repaired it. And in the surgery, what they did is they they took the the bottom and the top tendon, they sutured it back together, and they they twisted the tendon back together. The ligaments of the tendon, they they twisted it, knotted it, gathered those tendons back together. So, so my left Achilles, it's it's thicker, it's meatier, because there's this, there was this twisting done to strengthen the tendon. I'm not worried about my good, I'm not worried about my bad leg, I'm worried about my good leg. All right, my bad leg, it's all twisted and knotted together, it's not going anywhere because there's this, there's this strength there. There's this binding together. You know that God wants that, wants to do that with your heart. That God wants to twist and bind your heart to his, spiritually speaking. God is the great physician that he is. If you would allow him to do it today, he would go to work in your heart, fillet your heart wide open, and he would stitch your heart with his. They all go together. And so, what I want to do now in our remaining few seconds is I want to I want to pray for those of you who are experiencing difficulty, who are experiencing times of trouble. And that could be physically, spiritually, maybe you feel far from the Lord. I don't know. The Lord knows. I don't need to know. But what I want to do is I want to pray for you. And I I'm not gonna call on anybody, I'm not gonna call anybody out, I'm not gonna bring anybody up to share. And nobody's gonna ask you what what's going on in your life, but if you would be so bold and so humble, if you're experiencing some kind of trouble in your life, would you just raise your hand? Because we want to pray for you. Nobody's gonna ask you what it is. Keep your hand up if you're experiencing trouble in your life. Okay, if you don't have your hand up, but you see someone around you, raising their hand, would you lay your hand on their shoulder? Keep your hand up nice and high so that people can come alongside you and just gently put your hand on their shoulder. If you see someone, don't let anybody left out. I want you to put your hand on their shoulder, and would you agree with me now in prayer? Heavenly Father, I pray that you would you would pour out your your presence upon this place now, Lord. You see the hands raised, and those who don't have their hands raised, you see their hearts, Lord. And would you pour out your love and your mercy, your healing touch upon their life, Lord? Would you bring healing to bodies physically that are wounded? Lord, would you bring healing to mental healing to minds that have been overwhelmed with grief or trouble or anxious thoughts? Lord, someone, someone experiencing difficulty in their marriage or in their relationships, in their home life. Lord, would you bring your healing balm upon their home, upon their marriage, upon their relationships. Lord, we we are coming in agreement, Lord, asking for your help. Pour out your spirit upon us, Lord. And I pray that you would answer us according to your will, not ours, Lord. As we meet with you in the secret place, would you hide us under your wings, Lord? Would you conceal us in your pavilion, Lord, as David prays? And would you draw us close to your heart and would you bind our heart with yours, Lord? Would you unite our hearts with yours, Lord? Would you remove any bitterness or frustration or anger? And would you bring us joy and peace in the midst of this trouble? Would you encourage us and strengthen us? Would you would you do that twisting, binding work, Lord, to your heart right now, I pray in the name of Jesus. You see each individual need, meet them according to your will, and pour out your loving grace and mercy upon them, Lord. Gather them in. Collect them together into your heart. We leave this place, Lord, having now a confidence in you and what you can do, Lord, because of your power. We pray all of this in the wonderful name of Jesus and all God's people said. Amen.",
