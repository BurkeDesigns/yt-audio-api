  "transcript": "God's impressed with the amount you gave. If your whole heart the whole time is complaining and just you know reluctant to do this, not at all. God is most blessed by the attitude of our heart, not the amount in our hand. This is 2 Corinthians chapter 8, starting at verse 1. Paul writes, moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia, that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing, imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and then to us by the will of God. So we urged Titus that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. But as you abound in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us, see that you abound in this grace also. Now what is he talking about? It might make more sense as we read on. Go to chapter 9 now, and uh starting at verse 6. Paul writes, but this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity. For God loves a cheerful giver, and God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work, as it is written, he has dispersed abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, verse 10. Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, while you are enriched in everything for all liberality which causes thanksgiving through us to God. For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God. While through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men, and by their prayer for you, who long for you, because of the exceeding grace of God in you. Wow, that was a long sentence right there. And then he ends, verse 15 Thanks be to God for this for his indescribable gift. We'll talk more about what all this means. Let's first have a word of prayer. Father, we thank you, Lord, for this beautiful day you've given us. We ask you now to just settle our hearts as we just open up your word here, study these chapters together. We pray God you would give us clarity and understanding, and that we leave here learning some things that you want us to apply to our lives. So we give you praise and thanks for who you are. Thanks for loving us, and thank you, Jesus, for dying for us. And we give you the praise and the glory in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen. Well, again, we just go straight through the Bible. We come here to these two chapters in 2 Corinthians, and Paul has one main theme about which he writes these two chapters, and the one main theme that he's writing about here is generous giving. Now, before you tune me out and think, oh, he's just gonna shake us down on Mother's Day for an offering. Relax. Okay. Uh in fact, look, God has wonderfully provided for our church through your online giving through checks you drop, we have offering boxes around the church building, but because he's wonderfully provided, if you notice, we don't even receive an offering in the worship service itself. There's nothing wrong with that. Giving is worship. But I I simply say that because there's some of you that have a deep aversion to any pastor talking about things related to giving or money. And I understand it because, in large part, pastors and especially TV preachers have done damage to this topic by their greed and by preaching a prosperity gospel. That's not what we're about here. But what we are about is we go straight through the Bible, and just so happens, on Mother's Day, we land on two chapters that have to do with giving. So happy Mother's Day. You might be encouraged to know that several years ago I was in the book of Revelation on Mother's Day. Women left here weeping and gnashing their teeth, and so all things are relative. One of the beauties about going straight through the Bible is that we cover every topic eventually when we go cover to cover. Here are some facts about the subject of generosity and giving. The Bible has a few things to say. There are roughly 2,350 verses in the Bible concerning money. This is roughly twice as many verses than on the subjects of faith and prayer combined. Jesus spoke more about the stewardship of money than he spoke about heaven and hell combined. The only subject about which Jesus spoke more than he did material things is the kingdom of God. Sixteen out of thirty-eight parables that Jesus taught. Sixteen out of thirty-eight had to do with money, possessions, or material things. Now let me give you a little backstory and context to why Paul is writing these two chapters as he does. He spends two chapters writing about this. We're only going to spend one Sunday talking about it. You're welcome. But here's the context. Here's the backstory. This is the first century when Paul is writing this letter to the church in Corinth. Corinth is in the southern part of Greece. And Paul is writing this during a time in which there is great persecution against Christians. When I say persecution, I mean the torture and the murdering of Christians for their faith. Paul will write this letter around 56 AD, and a few years later will become the height of the of the persecution of Christians. I say height, I mean it still continues even today, but in the first century, the height, it really culminated 64 AD under Emperor Nero, when Rome caught on fire. Three years from 64 to 67 AD were horrible for Christians. They were murdered by the thousands. In 64 AD, when Rome caught on fire, Nero blamed the Christians for setting Rome on fire. The fact is that history records that it is more than likely Nero himself lit Rome on fire. History talks about how Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Why did he do that? Why would he have done that? Because Nero had asked the Roman Senate for money to refurbish the city of Rome, and they denied him the money. So history says it is believed that Nero then lit Rome on fire. It burned for six days. It consumed three-fourths of the city in 64 AD. And he blamed the Christians. And it led to tremendous martyring of Christians by the thousands. So Paul is writing this letter when there is persecution against Christians, but it hasn't yet broken out into full-blown martyrdom. You know what happens before they kill Christians? They cancel Christians. That should not encourage you. We're living in a cancel culture right now, where Christians are being targeted and persecuted for their faith. When you look at the first century Roman Empire, the slaughtering of Christians followed the canceling of Christians. So what you have, what we're dealing with here in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, is that because men and women have given their hearts to Christ, and they are under persecution, they have been shunned by the culture, they've been canceled by the culture. What does that mean? You own a business, we're not shopping at your store anymore. You're a Christian, it's the way to shun them, to marginalize them, to ostracize Christians in the first century. So they canceled them. And you had it especially bad if you were a Jew who was a believer in Jesus as Messiah. Because not only were you canceled by the culture, but you were disowned by your own family. You were a Jew who believed in Jesus as Messiah, your Jewish family who didn't believe that Jesus was Messiah, they held funerals for you. They disowned you. So now you're very isolated, particularly as a Jewish believer in Jesus in the first century. You're shunned by the culture. Nobody's coming to buy at your shop anymore, so you're destitute, and you are disowned by your family, so you're quite alone. So what Paul is writing here in chapters eight and nine, he's writing to the church in Corinth, that is largely a Gentile church, a church that he founded. Most of the churches that Paul founded throughout Europe were predominantly Gentile churches. And he's urging this Gentile church in Corinth to receive an offering to give it to the church in Jerusalem because that's where Jewish believers are, and they're hurting, they're dying. They're not only being martyred, but but they're being persecuted, they're being shunned, they're being disowned by their own families. They're destitute. And it appears in verses I didn't read with you this morning, Paul mentions twice that the church. Corinth had made a pledge a year earlier, and now Paul is saying you need to make good on that because they're suffering there in Jerusalem. The church in Jerusalem needs your offerings. And so he's urging them. Collect your offerings. He mentions Titus here. He says, Titus is going to, along with, he says, another brother, he mentions in verse 22, not by name, it's probably Luke. And he says, Titus and this other brother, probably Luke, are going to take your offerings. You can trust them, and they're going to deliver them to the church in Jerusalem, and it's going to help them. It's going to supply their needs because they are destitute. Now, the church at Corinth is not wealthy themselves. They've at least suffered under the shunning of the culture. They've been canceled by the culture, but they haven't been disowned by their families. Because Paul even commends them that out of their deep poverty, they gave even though they didn't have much themselves. And so Paul's urging them to be generous as much as they can. For their brothers and sisters of the church in Jerusalem needs your offerings, your support. Now I want to say two things about this, because I want to make sure that we understand proper context of the passage here. This is not advocating socialism. Okay. It's not advocating socialism. You know, the idea of, okay, this one church, you have some, you give it over here to this other church who doesn't have any. All right, this is not the redistribution of wealth to make everybody the same socioeconomic uh conditions. These are people who are who are impoverished, giving out of what they don't really have to those who are even more impoverished as a matter of survival. Okay, this is not the redistribution of wealth to make everybody economically the same. This is something that is done out of a complete necessity because of the times to share their resources with people who are dying. All right. Just because there is a practice in the Bible does not mean it is a principle in the Bible. One practice does not make it a pattern or a principle. Okay. This is not socialism, all right? We are not trying to take your money and distribute it so that everybody has equal share in this country. Even though at the same time I will fly on my private jets, and I'm a millionaire myself, but that doesn't really matter. Anyway, all right. Thank you, thank you, Bernie. But that's this is not, this is not Bernieism here, okay? This is just out of a desperate need for people who are not able to survive. The other important thing I want to point out about the context is that they are giving. The church in Corinth is urged to give, but they're giving to the Lord through the church. We say that again. They're giving to the Lord through the church. Their gifts were being used in the Lord's work as an act of worship to the Lord. The same is true today. We give to the Lord through the church. It is part of God's kingdom work that we are financing and blessing with our generosity. Look again in your Bibles at chapter 9, verse 11. And chapter 9, verse 11, the end of verse 11, he says, their generosity, quote, causes thanksgiving through us to God. It's through the church to the Lord. So that's the backstory. Paul's urging this church in Corinth, help out your brothers and sisters of the church in Jerusalem. Make good on this pledge that you promised a year ago. Titus and Luke are gonna come and they're gonna be faithful to take what you give, and they're gonna deliver to the church in Jerusalem. But within these two chapters, there are a few principles on generous giving that that I would like us to note. There's five that I'm gonna point out this morning. The first one is this if you're taking notes, giving is a spiritual discipline along with faith, speech, knowledge, diligence, and love. This is what Paul says back in chapter 8, verse 7. Look at your Bibles again, verse 7, he says, but as you abound in everything, as you excel in everything in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us, see that you abound in this grace also. Now, if you have an NIV translation, it actually says, grow in the grace of giving. That's the grace that he's talking about here. And he and he lumps giving in the same category with other disciplines like faith and knowledge and diligence and speech and love. And I don't know how you have normally thought about the discipline of giving, but uh, but a lot of people don't really lump the idea of giving in the same category as other church disciplines, as other Christian disciplines. Uh, we we think of you know, faith as a discipline, like, okay, I need to grow in my faith and my trust of the Lord. We think of speech as as a discipline of the of the Christian life. I need to watch my mouth and and and the the way I say it and how I say it, and I want to be Christ-like. We we also understand knowledge, these different things that he lists here. Of course, we want to grow in our knowledge of the Lord and of the word, and we want to be diligent, we want to persevere, we want to we want to be faithful and love. Love is in this category too, of course. We want to love one another as Christ loves us, and love, by the way, is a gopy in this verse. But within this category of Christian disciplines, Paul says, I want you to also grow in in the grace of giving. It is also a discipline of the Christian faith. Uh growing in giving is just as important as growing in faith and speech and knowledge and diligence and love. And you know, you could tell a lot about a person in the way that they manage money, can't you? You can tell a lot about their personality, you can tell a lot about their discipline or lack of it, you can tell a lot about their heart, their character, by the way they handle material things. Now, some of you are generous by nature, and some of you are generous because you have to work on it. But being generous by nature, and by the way, generosity is also a spiritual gift. Some of you actually have the gift of generosity, and some of you are naturally generous, and by the way, if you are, that's a wonderful trait, because you are following the example of our Father in heaven. Our Father is generous, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. You can't get more generous than that. Our Father gave his son Jesus for the sins of the whole world because of his love for us. That's generosity in a supreme way. So some of you are generous by nature. My wife is a very generous person by nature. She just is, ever since I've known her, she's been a very generous person. You can walk into our house just about on any day, and our dining room table is covered with gifts, gifts for somebody. Usually the grandkids, now that we have grandkids. I mean, I'll just come home and I'll be like, what? What? What's all this on the dining room table? Like we just we just cleared it off a bunch of gifts like last week. Now what? There's more gifts on the dining room table. Well, well, and I say things like, what's the holiday? Like, what a what's the what? I don't think there's actually a holiday right now. And and she's like, Well, there's the holidays somewhere. I'm like, you know, that's what alcoholics say, you know. It's like, what why are you drinking at 10 o'clock in the morning? Well, there's a holiday somewhere. You know, like I don't think there's a holiday right now. My wife, seriously, she's a generous drunk, is what she is. She's she is drunk on generosity. I'm generous too, but you'd never know it because I have to compensate for her extra generosity. Just because I want to eat. You know what I'm saying? So some of you, God bless you, generous, modeling right after our father in heaven. He's a generous father. Number two, giving is an act of grace and not a commandment of law. Did you notice that when we read those other Christian disciplines, faith, speech, knowledge, diligence? This is verse 7, love for us, see that you abound in this grace also. Notice how Paul refers to giving as grace, not as a commandment. In fact, the very next verse, this is chapter 8, verse 8. He says, I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. He even contrasted there between verse 7 and verse 8. He says, Giving is a matter of grace. He says, I don't speak as a commandment here. Go to chapter 9. Let me point out verse 5 from chapter 9. He says, Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which you had previously promised, that it may be ready as a matter of generosity and not as a grudging obligation. You see that. Now, I I want to make this clear. I've said this at different times when we've gone through the Bible and we've come to passages on the subject of tithing. I do believe that the biblical principle of tithing is still applicable today. What does that mean? It means that a tenth of all that we Earned, I do believe the Bible as a principle tells us that that first tenth that belongs to the Lord. And we should thank God that we can at least live off a 90% of what He's given us, because He's given us 100%, but that tithe belongs to the Lord. Now, that is mostly Old Testament, although Jesus does endorse it in the New Testament. In Matthew chapter 23, 23, he rebukes the religious the religious leaders of his day. He says, Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, for you pay a tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former. He says, You should be about justice, mercy, and faithfulness, but you should also still recognize that that tenth belongs to the Lord. Okay, so I still do believe that the principle is intact. However, Paul reminds us we're not under law anymore, we're under grace. He says, This is the grace of giving. I want you to grow in the grace of giving. But here's the challenge for me, and I share it with you. This is where I'm challenged. I know that grace does more than the law. Grace is greater than the law. The law kills the spirit, gives life. Grace is more abundant for us. So therefore, now that we're under grace, I don't think I should do anything less than what the minimum of the law used to require. Now that I'm under grace, I have the generosity and the liberality. Because it's about not the mandate of the law, but giving is about the motivation of the heart, which leads us to point number three. Giving is like sowing and reaping. The return is proportional to the gift. Now, this is verse six of chapter 9. Listen to what Paul writes here. He says, But this I say, who who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Okay, this is this is farming terminology, right? He's talking about sowing and reaping, planting and harvesting. Um this is where this verse in particular is where I think some TV preachers have really abused people by saying things like, you know, sow your gift of a thousand dollars into my ministry, and God will return it tenfold to you, because after all, if you sow sparingly, you'll reap sparingly, but you sow generously, you'll reap generously. So give now your thousand dollar love offering. I mean, uh, please. Really? Is that what this verse means? That you give to get rich? No. What but what he's saying here is there is this attached reciprocal benefit that God just will bless those who bless. And and and what he's saying here in general is if you give generously, God will take care of you generously. You can trust him to provide for you in every way. This is we we don't we don't give to get. We give because we want to honor the Lord, but God says, freely you have given, freely I will return a blessing to you, in ways that sometimes money can't even measure. God is a generous, loving Father, and he will take care of us. This is number four. Giving is as much about what's in your heart as it is about what's in your hand. Look again at verse 7, where he says, So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver. Please notice this. God loves a cheerful giver. What blesses God is not that we give or even what we give, it's how we give it. It's how we give it. It's the attitude of our heart that he looks at. That's what God is most honored by. Because I mean, think about it. If if if we if we're giving begrudgingly, you're like, oh, yeah, okay, God, you know, you you gave me everything, so all right, I'll give you a portion of this back. And you give this huge amount. You think God's impressed with the amount you gave? If your whole heart the whole time is complaining and just, you know, reluctant to do this, not at all. God is most blessed by the attitude of our heart, not the amount in our hand. And the prophet Jeremiah reminds us the importance of the heart. The prophet Jeremiah declared that the Lord tests the righteous and sees the heart. Jeremiah 20, verse 12. In Proverbs 21, 2, it says the Lord weighs the heart. So Jeremiah says, tests and sees the heart. Proverbs says the Lord weighs the heart. When it came time for Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel after Saul, he he goes to anoint David, and God's instruction to Samuel was for the Lord does not see as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at what? The heart. And then when David handed the mantle to Solomon as the next king of Israel, in 1 Chronicles 28, 9, David exhorts him, saying, As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father and serve him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. God does not want your offering given in resentment or out of obligation. And here's something you may not often hear pastors say, if you don't have a grateful heart, please keep your money. Please keep your money. God doesn't need it, and we don't want it as a church. If you're doing something out of obligation instead of freely, because you just want to love the Lord and help the work of the kingdom. Number five, the last one is this. Giving is noticed by the Lord, and he will always take care of your needs. This is verse 8 of chapter 9, verse 8, and God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. I love the way that Paul writes it that way. He says, always having all sufficiency in all things. In other words, God will take care of us. We will not lack with him. You know, sometimes we think, well, if I, and look, you know, we need to be wise. We need to, we need to, you know, be good stewards of all that he's given us. Umbody should be frivolous about things, but the fear that we won't have enough if we give too much is just a fear that is rooted in a lie, because our father will always take care of us. What is Philippians 4 19 says, and my God shall supply all my needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. And I don't think that only means material needs. I think that's a broad statement that means he'll take care of my emotional needs, physical needs, material needs, because my father loves me, and he's and he's gonna always take care of me. So I can't worry about being generous because I'm afraid I will lack. In fact, David would write in Psalm 37, 25. He says, I have been young and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaking, forsaken, nor his children begging bread. David said, I know God's gonna take care of us. I've never seen God's children begging for bread. God will take care of us. So may we all grow in the grace of giving and do it as unto the Lord from the motivation of the heart, the right heart, being grateful for all that he has given us. Amen. Let's pray together. Father, thank you for your word and thank you, Lord, for all that you've blessed us with. We we want to make sure that we're also being a blessing to you, to others, to the kingdom's work. So, Father, help us to be good managers and stewards of the resources that you've entrusted to our care, knowing that you will always take care of us, Lord. And Lord, I'm just prompted right now to thank you for the many letters I've gotten over the years from sweet elderly ladies who tell me they're in their 80s, and here they send to the church a check for $5, $10, $25, just giving out of their poverty. Lord, thank you for those who've been so faithful to give and to bless your work. And we we are just so thankful, Lord, for the many ways you've provided here, and we pray that we would be good stewards of all that you've entrusted to us as a church. And thank you, Lord, that you have blessed us in such abundant ways in order for us to be a blessing for your continued good work. And so, Lord, we thank you for the privilege of being generous givers. And we just give you the glory and the honor and the praise. Thank you again for all the moms on this Mother's Day. Bless them, Lord, as they go to their respective homes today. Comfort those who are alone today. Minister your grace and your peace to their hearts as well. We thank you in Jesus' name and everybody said, Amen and amen. God bless you everybody.",
