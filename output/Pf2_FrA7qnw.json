  "transcript": "Good morning. Good morning, good morning, good morning. Jesus is alive. There is a there is a proverb. I need to turn it down just a little bit. There's a proverb, Proverb twenty-seven. Well, it's loud enough for our neighbors, I guarantee you. Proverbs twenty-seven fourteen says, if you loudly greet your neighbor early in the morning. So we don't want our neighbors to think we are cursing them this early in the morning, but I'm so glad that you are here. Wow, I didn't expect sunrise to draw this kind of a crowd. And people are still coming, they're still walking. So praise God for our new courtyard and praise the Lord for this day that He has given us to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. We are here in the house of the Lord on this beautiful day the Lord has given us to give praise to him and to worship him. So our team's gonna lead us in a few songs, and I'll come back up and share God's word this morning. Shall we all stand together? Let's sing this out to the Lord. Here we go.

Who praise His name? Forevermore. For this. We will sing a praise. Alright. Amen. Let's pray. Thank you, Jesus, for this beautiful morning. Lord, that you died on the cross. Lord rose again on the third day, Lord rose for our sake. Praise you. We worship you. We thank you, Lord, that we get to celebrate that this morning. We sing of you, glory, Lord, for what you did on the cross, Lord. For our sake that you loved us so much. That you came down to this earth. We thank you, Lord. We worship you. We give you this time, Lord. Give you all the glory. Pray all this in the name of Jesus. Amen. You guys can be seated. We just are trying to be good neighbors. And uh, so that's why the acoustics were a little low. And uh, if you notice, it was the younger worship team that could get up at 6:30 in the morning. Yeah, they did a great job. I'm gonna share out of John's Gospel chapter 20. This teaching's gonna be different from the one I share in the sanctuary. Uh, as I said when we announced the sunrise service, I figured that people who would get up and come this early in the morning probably already knew Jesus. Um, and so this is not geared as a salvation message, this is just geared as an encouragement and a reminder to the saints that we serve the risen Lord Jesus, amen. And what a beautiful day he's given us, and the first time we use the courtyard, and we've already outgrown it, so uh we gotta start digging again, I guess. This is John's gospel, chapter 20. I'm gonna read the first 18 verses. It says, Now the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early while it was still dark, and this is where we get the tradition of a sunrise service, by the way. She gets there to the tomb while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb, and then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved. That's John writing his own gospel saying that. And she said to them, they have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him. Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple and were going to the tomb, and so they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter. John has to throw that in, that he's a better athlete, and he came to the tomb first, and he, John, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there, yet he did not go in. And then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb, and he saw the linen cloths lying there, and the handkerchief that had been around his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together in a place by itself. And then the other disciple who came to the tomb first went in also, and he saw and believed, for as yet they did not know the scripture that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again to their own homes, but Mary stood outside the tomb weeping, and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And then they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? And she said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him. Now when she had said this, she turned around, and she saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. She supposed him to be the gardener and said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned and said to him, Raboni, which is to say teacher. It's the more expanded form, it's a more reverential form than just rabbi, Raboni. And she says this, and Jesus said to her, do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to my father, but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my father and your father and to my God and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things to her. Let's pause and pray. Heavenly Father, on this glorious Sunday morning that you've given us here today, we we gather in this courtyard to give you praise and glory and honor for bringing Jesus into the world to die for our sins. And not only did he die for our sins, and not only was he buried, but you rose him from the dead. You raised him from the dead, he rose again that we might have life and life to the fullest. Life here abundantly, life in heaven eternally, and we just give you the praise and the glory. We hear the birds singing, Lord, a reminder of your creation as we gather here outside to give glory to the risen Savior on this resurrection Sunday. So thank you, Lord, for being here. Thank you for your word and thank you for rising from the dead as our hope for eternal life. We give you the praise and the glory in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen. I want to share three things with you about the resurrection. As a reminder and an encouragement to us who love him. The first is this. Number one, the resurrection of Jesus is factual. It is factual. Dr. Simon Greenleaf, former professor of law at Harvard University, who helped to develop Harvard Law School in the 1800s. This is before they're about to lose their tax exempt status. Dr. Simon Greenleaf said this quote, according to the laws of legal evidence used in courts of law, there is more evidence for the historical fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ than for just about any other event in history. End quote. Many people over the centuries have tried to disprove the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the course of trying to disprove it, they actually came to know him in a personal way. Let me give you a few examples from the 19th century. Famed atheist Robert Ingersoll, who was a politician and an orator. He was nicknamed the great agnostic. He traveled the country speaking against the claims of Christ and the church. He had a good friend. Ingersoll's friend was Major General Lou Wallace. He was a Union officer of the Civil War. General Wallace was influenced by Ingersoll, and he set out to write a book that disproved the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Wallace's wife was a Christian. So she was praying for her husband as he was writing this book, trying to disprove the claims of the resurrection of Christ. When Wallace got to the fourth chapter of his book, he found Jesus. He came to know Jesus, and so he redid his work and entitled it, you're familiar, Ben Hur. In the 20th century, Albert Henry Ross, who was a freelance writer who went by the pseudonym Frank Morrison, he set out to write a paper to disprove the resurrection of Christ, and he called his paper Jesus, The Last Phase. When in the process of his research, he also met Jesus, and so he re-word rewrote the work and entitled it, Who Moved the Stone. In the late 1950s, an agnostic college student by the name of Josh McDowell took a challenge from some of his classmates to disprove the claims of Christ and his resurrection. McDowell was a pre-law student, and so he gladly took the challenge. He even took time off school to research in some of the best libraries in Europe. In the process of his research, trying to disprove the claims of Christ that he had risen from the dead, Josh McDowell met Jesus, and in 1972, he published his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict. In the 1980s, a journalist, a lawyer, an atheist by the name of Lee Strobel began investigating the biblical claims of Christ after his wife's conversion. When in the course of his investigation to disprove the claims of Christ, he met Jesus, and he wrote a book entitled The Case for Christ. So if you have any atheist or agnostic friends who don't believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, tell them to write a book, disproving the claims of Christ. They'll meet him, they'll find him when they do their own homework. It is a factual event. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is historical and factual. And hundreds of thousands of people have given their lives in defense of this fact. You know, some people might be willing to die for the truth, but who is willing to die for a lie? If this whole thing were a hoax, why would the apostles and the martyrs who followed them subject themselves to torture if they really thought that they were defending something that wasn't true? No, they were willing to lay down their lives because in fact they knew that the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ was indeed factual. More people have died in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the last century than in the previous twenty combined. More and more people are willing to die for this truth. No one is really willing to die for a lie. The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus is factual. Number two, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is powerful. It is powerful. To rise from the dead proves your authority, proves legitimacy, it proves credibility. Jesus predicted that he would rise from the dead. No less than ten times throughout the gospel. It is recorded how Jesus told his disciples in advance that he would be betrayed, he would suffer, he would die, and on the third day he would rise from the dead. It's not only powerful to actually rise from the dead, but it's doubly powerful to tell people in advance that you're going to rise from the dead. Example, in Mark 9 31, Jesus said to his disciples, the Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him. And after three days, he will rise. On one of Paul's missionary journeys through Europe, and in this particular case, he's quoted in Acts 13, preaching in Turkey. Paul would say this in Acts 13, 28. And though they found no cause for death in him, they asked Pilate that he should be put to death. Now, when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead. He was seen for many days by those who came upon him, with who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people. And we declare to you glad tidings. That promise which was made to the fathers, God has fulfilled this for us, their children, in that he has raised up Jesus. God has raised up Jesus. No other religious leader did what Jesus did, because no one had the power to do what Jesus did. And this is why it's important for people to understand, whenever you hear this narrative in the culture that all paths lead to God and all religions are the same, that just isn't true. When you look at how distinguished Christianity is from all other world religions, the linchpin of Christianity is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. No other religious leader rose from the dead. Confucius is buried in a tomb in eastern China. Guatemab was cremated, and his ashes, hair, and teeth are scattered in shrines across 24 countries. And Muhammad is buried in Medina. Why would anyone want to follow a dead man when you could follow a living Lord? Amen. Jesus is infinitely supremely divinely eternally superior to any other religious figures. He is above all, he is over all, he is greater than all. Jesus is God, Jesus is Lord, Jesus is Savior. He is the all-powerful, all-knowing, ever-present, eternal king and creator of the universe. Amen. He relates to different people in different ways. Example, he's the bread of life, so that bakers can understand him. He's the living water, so plumbers can understand him. He's the light of the world, so electricians can understand him. He's the cornerstone, so architects can understand him. He's the life, so biologists can understand him. He's the great physician, so doctors and nurses can understand him. He's the advocate, so lawyers can understand him. He's the good teacher for educators. He's the lily of the valley for florists. He's the rock of ages for geologists. He's the righteous one for judges. He's wisdom for philosophers. He's the good shepherd for farmers. He's the king of kings for royalty. He's our hope for counselors. He's the truth for pastors. He's our savior for everybody. Finally, the third important fact behind the resurrection of Jesus Christ is it is personal. It is factual, it is powerful, it is personal. Mahatma Gandhi once said, God is that. Indefinable something that we all feel but which we cannot know. Well, Gandhi was wrong because God is knowable. The true and living God is personal. The Bible says in Romans 5 8 that God demonstrated his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. That's a personal God, taking a personal interest in humanity by coming to earth to die for us. Jesus then even gave us this promise. I mean, how much more personal can you get than that? Jesus saying, I'm looking out for you. I came, I died, I bled on a cross, I was buried, and I rose again for you. For everyone in the human race, Jesus offers his life and powerfully rose from the dead to prove his power and authority over sin and death. And he offers this on a personal basis. I love in this story that we opened up with in John chapter 20, how personal he was with Mary Magdalene. You know, there she is going to the tomb early in the morning while it's still dark. And she gets there and she sees an empty tomb. She runs back, she tells some of the disciples, Peter and John book it to the tomb, and they see also an empty tomb, but then it says that they just they go home. Probably because they're bewildered, they're trying to process all of it. But Mary stays right there, and she's just weeping, she's weeping. She asked, she is asked first by the angels, why are you weeping? She says, Somebody's taken my Lord's body. We don't, I don't know where they've laid him. Then Jesus comes up behind her, she sees him, and she thinks he's the gardener. And he asks the same question, woman, why are you weeping? She said she gives the same answer. Now, why is it that she did not recognize Jesus at first? Remember, Mary Magdalene, the Bible says, out of her was cast seven demons by Jesus. Jesus was very uh familiar with her, she was very familiar with him. She was part of traveling with the disciples for three and a half years of Jesus' ministry. Why wouldn't she recognize him when she saw him? I think there are a few legitimate reasons. One, maybe because of context. You know, here she is in this garden, and somebody comes up to her, and in the context of a garden, she thinks it's gonna be the gardener. So Jesus is like out of context in the moment. Maybe another reason she didn't recognize him as at first is just pure shock. Now I've seen people when they go into shock because of some tragedy, they they have a hard time processing information. They're just in a place of shock and disbelief and discouragement. I think there could be another reason, and the other reason might be simply that Mary had in her head a preconceived idea. And the preconceived idea was dead people stay dead. And when you think dead people stay dead, you're not thinking of talking to a dead person. And so she had this in her head. It's really hard to shake something once you're convinced of it in your own mind. Now, I've told this story here at Cornerstone before, but I'm gonna tell it again because I think it perfectly illustrates how you can get some preconceived thing in your head, and then you're stuck there. So many years ago, when our kids were little, I was going through, yes, don't judge me, the drive-thru of McDonald's. And uh it was like October, November when they come out with those pumpkin shakes, okay, those seasonal pumpkin shakes. And so we're going through the drive-thru. Tyler, I think was like 13, Austin was 10, only the two boys, Lindsay wasn't in the car with me. And I said to the guys, hey, I'm gonna go through the drive-thru, I'm gonna get a pumpkin shake. You guys want a pumpkin shake? No, we're fine. But we'll, you know, I knew what it meant. They want to taste it after I get it. Well, it's fine. So I got the pumpkin shake. I'm driving off, I'm slurping it. I'm like, guys, this is delicious. You guys need to try this. And so I passed it over to Tyler. We're a family, it's okay, you can drink out of the same straw. And so I pass it over to Tyler. He takes a sip of it. He goes, Wow, this is good. This is delicious. And then Austin's like, well, give me some of that. He's in the backseat. So I we pass it back to Austin. He takes uh slurp out of it, and he goes, guys, this is chocolate. What? No, it's not. It's pumpkin. I'm positive. No, it's chocolate, Dad. He passed it back up. I took the lid off. Sure enough, it was chocolate. But I so they gave me the wrong milkshake. But I had it in my head. This has to be pumpkin. So even as I'm drinking it, and Tyler too, I led him astray. I'm convinced this has this has to be pumpkin. Because I had it in my head. And it wasn't until like I examined it that I realized it is chocolate. It is chocolate. So perhaps Mary is like in that mode where she's like, Jesus is his body's missing, but I can't be talking to him because I got it in my head, he's dead. Until when was it that she recognized that it was Jesus? Did you did you see it when we were reading through the text? The answer is when he called her by name. At first, when Jesus said, Woman, why are you weeping? And by the way, that's not disrespectful back in the day to say woman. In our vernacular, it would be ma'am. Okay, so he's just he's just using an endearing term. He's like, ma'am, why are you weeping? It wasn't until he spoke her name that then she realized this was the Lord. Again, it's verse 15 and 16. He says, Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away. And Jesus said to her, Mary, exclamation mark. And she turned and said to him, Raboni, which is to say teacher. It was when Jesus got personal and spoke her name that she realized this is Jesus. And I love that about our Lord. He's a personal savior. He knows us by name. He knows you. And he loves you. He's familiar with all of us in every way. Did you know this? The Bible says that when we get to heaven, the Lord gives us a new name. Did you know that the name you've been given by your parents is a name that you have now, but will not be the name that you have when you get to heaven. Why is that? Because here on earth we were named by our earthly father or mother. When we get to heaven, we're going to be named by our heavenly father, because it's a new life in him. Let me tell you where the passage is. It's Revelation 2, verse 17. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna to eat, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it. And so your parents named you. That was for your life here on earth. But your father in heaven will give you a new name for your life there. Let me close by reading what Peter said about this good news concerning the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In his first epistle, 1 Peter 1, 3 and 4. He said, Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade, kept in heaven for you. What Peter tells us there is this glorious, wonderful news of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, has two great benefits for us who believe. Number one, he says, a living hope. There are a lot of people who have been crushed by hopelessness in this lifetime. Because they don't know the hope that they can have in Jesus. People who are on the brink of bankruptcy or despair or having suicidal thoughts in the world. A broken relationship, the loss of a loved one, physical or emotional pain. People who have suffered in silence, living with grief or shame. You can't always recognize them. Sometimes they hide it well and they look just like the next person. But they're hurting because they have no hope. Brad Delp, who was the former lead singer for the group Boston. He committed suicide and left a note pinned on his shirt. He had written it in French. Mr. Brad Delp, j'ai une âme solitaire. Mr. Brad Delp, I am a lonely soul. A lot of hopeless people in this world who need the hope of Jesus that we have. Romans 15 13 says, May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. Don't you love that? Overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. This is what God gives us. That isn't to say that life won't still have its heartaches at will. But when we have the hope of Jesus Christ, we know the one who will see us through every heartache of this life. And the other thing that Peter says there in this passage not only do we have a living hope, but we have an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade, kept in heaven for you. You know, you can't receive an inheritance unless someone dies. So Jesus died, and the inheritance we receive is forgiveness of sins in Him, and then the eternal home of heaven when we die. That is our eternal inheritance. It's being kept for us. And this is the hope of the church, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that we might have a living hope and an eternal inheritance in Him. And folks, what a great day for us to gather here to celebrate this good news because Jesus is alive forever and ever and ever. And we shall be with him forever and ever and ever. Shall we pray together? Our Father in heaven, we give you the praise for who you are for what you've done by raising Jesus from the dead. Jesus coming to earth to save us from our sins, dying on a cross, taking the punishment that we deserved, taking the judgment that we deserved. Dying on that cross, being buried three days later, rising from the dead. And we thank you, Lord, that we can serve a risen Lord, that our hope is in Jesus. We pray for this world, Lord, that they would come to know the same hope that we know. Lord, use us with our friends and family and co-workers to spread the good news of who you are, that they might also know the hope that we have and the internal, the eternal inheritance that we have through faith in Jesus Christ. And we give you the praise and the glory and the honor that you rose from the dead, and we join with tens of thousands of other people around the world who are celebrating this wonderful truth. It is factual, it is powerful, it is personal that Jesus Christ died, was buried, rose again, ascended back into heaven, and is coming again. And we give you all the praise, all the glory, and all the honor in Jesus' name. And everybody said, Amen and amen. Amen. Well, show yourself friendly to someone. We have another service. Uh well, actually, we have four more coming up today. So I gotta scoot to the next service. God bless you all. Have a wonderful day. Jesus is alive. Amen.",
