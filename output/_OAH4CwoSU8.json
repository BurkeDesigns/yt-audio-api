  "transcript": "A bright light awoke me from my sleep. As the shepherds gasped, I saw what they saw. Angels. How'd you like to see a king? Dad asked. Yes, I said, so I ran to get my drum. As we walked, we huddled close to stay warm. A bright star pierced the dark sky. Soon, a company of wise men appeared. Dad called them magi. That one brings gold for the king, the shepherd whispered, and that one frankinson said another, and myrrh besides. Then at the wise men's gifts. Then I turned to see the star shining above us, and my chest felt heavy. I thought I don't belong here. Come, he said. Certainly not dressed to meet a king. But none of that mattered when I saw him. A baby, so littled and swaddled up in rags like mine. I was not afraid, not one bit. What can I give to you? There's nothing that's fit for you. No silver or gold, just a heart to compose for you, my king. Peace honor in mercy my God and sin.

And then finally, come back Sunday for our regular worship services this Sunday, December 28th, 8:15, 10 o'clock, and 12 noon. We hope to see you back to worship the Lord with us. But for tonight, we're gonna be looking at the Christmas story together. I'm gonna read out of Luke's Gospel, chapter two. This is probably familiar to most of you. And so let me read Luke 2, verses 1 to 14. And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria, and all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary as a spoused wife, being great with child. And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds, abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that shall be for all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you, you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel, a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, goodwill toward men. Let's pray together. Father in heaven, we're so grateful to be able to come here in your house and to celebrate your grand entrance into our world, the birth of Jesus Christ. And Father, for many of us who already know you in a personal way, this is a wonderful time of celebration. And I pray for those who were here tonight or watching online, and they don't really have a relationship with you. And I pray that before the service is over tonight that they will know you in a personal way. Thank you, Lord, for loving us. Thank you for coming into our world to save us. We commit the service to you and for your glory in Jesus' name. And everyone said, Amen. Amen. 18 years ago, the Washington Post conducted an experiment with the help of Joshua Bell. Now, Joshua Bell is probably considered the greatest violin virtuoso of our time. And so on a chilly January day in Washington, DC, Joshua Bell donned a pair of blue jeans and uh Nat's baseball cap. And he took his violin, a three and a half million dollar stratavious violin made in 1713. And he went downtown DC to the La Font Plaza Metro station. He positioned himself inside the Metro station during morning rush hour as commuters were coming and going. He laid his violin case at his feet, and then he began to play. Bach and Schubert. And the experiment was conducted for two reasons. One, because they wanted to see how many people would actually stop to listen to the music and to realize that they were in the presence of someone pretty great with some pretty amazing talent. And number two, they wanted to see how much money people would throw into his violin case. Considering that this guy commands hundreds of dollars per ticket at his concerts. The results, after 43 minutes, about 1,100 people had passed by, but only seven stopped to listen to the music. 27 threw in money that Totaled a whopping $32.17. But the vast majority, 1,100 people just hurried by, didn't even look at Joshua Bell, oblivious to how great the moment was with such amazing talent. That story reminds me of how a lot of people relate to the Christmas story. Just hurried, just doing all the things we do at Christmas time. Perhaps some people obviously not even aware of what the real message of Christmas is all about. And so the vast majority of people are just breezing right by the greatest story ever told. And here's a summary of this greatest story ever told. That God so loved us that he left the glory of heaven and he stepped into our world. And he came through the birth of a baby by a virgin young woman by the name of Mary, where God wrapped himself in humanity, and Jesus Christ was born in a little obscure at that time village called Bethlehem in Israel, where Jesus was born for you and me in order to grow up to die for you and me on a cross to save us from our sins. That's really the summary of the Christmas message. God came into our world to rescue us, to save us from our sins. Now, when you look at this original Christmas story, it has both natural and supernatural elements to it. The natural element of the story is this is a baby who was born, just like millions of other babies who were born every day. This is a real baby boy born to a real young woman in a real tiny village on a real designated day. This was very natural in terms of natural childbirth. Remember, this was during a time when they didn't have the modern conveniences of medicine like we do today. So Mary's giving birth to a baby. There's no, there's no sterile birthing in. There's no fetal heart monitor, there's no epidural, no ice chips, no doctors. This is back in a day when women had babies by hugging a tree or biting down on a stick. You know what I'm saying to you? And I don't mean to say, ladies, that you have it easy today, but anyway, back to the story. And so, so anyway, you all know, I'm sure most of you are familiar with the fact that Bethlehem is so overcrowded, but by the time Joseph and Mary get there, there's no room for them in the inn. The reason is because the Roman government, which controls Israel at this time as part of the Roman Empire, the Roman government has issued a decree that all the world should be taxed. The only way they know who to tax is to count heads. So the order was given for everyone to return to the village or town of their forefathers and to be counted in a census. Well, Joseph and Mary were both descendants of King David. King David had been born in Bethlehem, so off to Bethlehem they go. But so did a lot of other people. And thus, when they get there, there's no room for them in the end, so they end up in a stable, or probably more likely a cave of some sort. And there may have been animals around. The Bible doesn't tell us that, but it does say that they laid Jesus in a manger when he was born, and a manger is an animal feeding trough. So this is a very natural birth. This is a very natural element to the whole Christmas story. But then, of course, there are supernatural elements to this story. You can't talk about this first Christmas without talking about some of the supernatural elements. In the first place, the very conception of Jesus was supernatural. Jesus was not the biological product of union between Joseph and Mary. Joseph was not Jesus' biological father. The Bible makes it clear that the Holy Spirit came upon Mary in power, and the very seed of God was implanted in the in the womb of this young virgin woman, and thus the seed of God being planted in her womb, she would give birth to the Son of God. So the very conception was supernatural. It was miraculous. As well as the birth announcement, which we just read a moment ago. When this angel comes upon the shepherds and announces the birth of Jesus Christ, it was very supernatural moment when you have angels showing up. You know, I don't know what your gender reveal was for your kid, but I bet it didn't involve angels. You thought you were all fancy with your blue or pink confetti being shot out of a cannon. Well, try angels showing up at your birth announcement, at your gender reveal. That's what happens at Jesus' birth announcement. This angel shows up. And then the Bible says in the passage I read earlier that a whole multitude of angels joined the one angel. And they declare there in verse 14 of Luke 2, glory to God and the highest and on earth peace, goodwill toward men. But before the whole multitude showed up, it was just this one. This one angel who shows up and declares in Luke 2, verses 10 and 11, fear not, for I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be for all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. I want to take a few minutes to just talk about the four two-word statements that angel makes. Fear not, good news, great joy, all people. Fear not, good news, great joy, all people. So the first is fear not. Now, the obvious reason why the angel had to say fear not to these shepherds is because the story tells us they were watching their sheep at night. You have an angel appearing, glowing, lighting up the night sky, and you're not expecting this. You're gonna be terrified. And so the and the reason they were terrified, look, angels, the Bible describes as majestic, powerful, awesome creatures of God. Don't think of angels like the little chubby babies on a cloud playing a harp. Think more like Dwayne the Rock Johnson with wings and a sword. Showing up. You're gonna be terrified. So the angel's like, yo, whoa, calm down, it's okay, fear not. But I love those two words because I think it's just as important for us to hear those two words today. Fear not. A lot of people carry around a lot of fears about things. And this story is a good reminder to us that God is not the author of fear. In fact, the Bible says in 1 John 4 18, perfect love drives out fear. And 1 John 4 8 says, God is love. So you put it together, God is love, perfect love drives out fear, which tells me this that the more I have of God, the less I have a fear. Fear not. How many of you show of hands? How many of you at some point in your life have ever seen the Charlie Brown Christmas special? Let me see your hands. Okay, most of you. I watched it when I was a kid, my kids watched it when they were kids, my grandkids watch it now. It first debuted in 1965 on CBS television. Now, Linus, one of the peanuts characters, Linus is always known for what? What does he always have with him? His blanket, that little security blanket. He always carries it around, and all the kids always are trying to get the blanket from him, and he never lets it go. But there's one scene in all of the Peanuts series where Linus willingly lets go of his blanket. And it's in the Charlie Brown Christmas special. It's when Linus gets up on stage and he reads Luke chapter 2, the verses I read earlier, and when he gets to verse 10, and he reads the words of the angel, fear not, he lets go of his blanket. Now you're gonna go home and check that out, aren't you? You're gonna watch it, and mark my word, he does. He lets go of it and he reads the rest of the passage before he picks it up and walks off stage. Charles Schultz, the writer of the Peanuts series, did a brilliant thing, very subtle, but it was brilliant. He was communicating a message that Linus, like all of us, can let go of your fears and insecurities when you believe the story of the Prince of Peace of Jesus who came to save us from our sins. When I know the Prince of Peace, I can let go of my fears and insecurities. So fear not, the angel says. Then good news. I bring you good news. Ladies and gentlemen, if we ever were living in a time where we needed to hear a little good news, it is now. I was thinking just this week of some of the bad headlines of just the last month, just the last month and the last four weeks. Two National Guards members were shot in Washington, D.C., one killed, one still fighting for life. The Brown University murders, the MIT professor murdered, the Jews on Bondi Beach in Australia murdered, Rob Reiner and his wife murdered, allegedly by their own son. NASCAR driver, Greg Biffle, his wife and kids and their friends, died in that fiery plane crash a few days ago. Look, folks, there's no shortage of bad news. Our phones are constantly pumping out one bad headline after another. So if there's ever a time we needed to be reminded of some good news, it is today, when the angel says, For unto you was born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. The good news is that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners like me, to save sinners like you, and that is good news. News that'll beat any bad headline of any day for the rest of your life. That's the gospel. Paul would write in 1 Timothy 1 15. Here is a trustworthy saying that is worthy of full acceptance. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. This is why Jesus would say in John 3 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. This is good news. And this good news number three brings great joy. Great joy. See, when you know personally the story and believe that God loves you so much, he came to the earth to forgive us of our sins, to die on that cross, so that I might have my sins forgiven, so that I might be rescued from this fallen world to go to heaven when I die. There's no more joyful news than knowing that. That's joyful news. That's news of great joy. Now, joy is typically not a word that we use in everyday conversation. I mean, maybe more so for Christians who know their Bibles because joy is a good word throughout the Bible. But in everyday conversation, most people don't use the word joy. I mean, it just isn't a common everyday term. Unless your name is joy or you like eating almond joy, you probably don't use the word. Somebody asks you, hey Brandon, how was your vacation? Ah, dude, it was full of joy, bruh. I mean, I don't think so. I don't think you talk like that. Most people don't. They say I had a good vacation, a fun vacation. I don't normally say I had a joyful vacation. But joy is a much better word than happiness, and you better know the difference. Happiness is very circumstantial. Happiness comes and goes like the weather changes. One day you can be happy based on how well your day is going. The next day you can be sad because you didn't have a good day. And most people live somewhere in that roller coaster. Good days, bad days. One day I'm happy, one day I'm not. But see, joy is so much better because joy transcends every good day or bad day that you might have. And the reason is because hear me on this. Real joy is found in Jesus. That's the reason. Real joy is found in Jesus. Now that isn't to say that if you know Jesus as your Savior, you're never gonna have another bad day. What it is to say is that when you know Jesus as your Savior, you never have another bad day without him. And he becomes this constant in your life. In fact, the biblical definition for joy is calm delight. He just brings this calm delight, so that joy in Jesus means I have peace in the storm. I have hope in sorrow. I have calm and chaos because Jesus is with me. Because Jesus is in control, because Jesus has got this. So I can trust him. This is the reason why we sing joy to the world at Christmas time. No more joyful news that than to hear that God came into the world to save us from our sins. This is good, joyful news. And let me tell you, there are a lot of people who need a lot of joy today. And some of you are sitting right here or watching online. I've been in ministry for 38 years now, and I've seen a lot of people who deal with some serious pain and sorrow and suffering in their own lives, and most of the time you'd never know it. There's people probably in your row, or it might be you yourself dealing with some pain right now. And most people cope quietly. Most people suffer in silence, and you would never know. I read a quote once by Charlie Chaplin, who was a famous actor during the silent movie era. And Charlie Chaplin said this. He said, Quote, I always like walking in the rain, because then no one can see that I'm crying. I think there are a lot of people who walk in the rain. We just don't know. Maybe you're here tonight and you could use a good dose of joy yourself. The angel says, Fear not, I bring you good news of great joy, and the last one is for all people. This is good news of great joy for all people. This was not just intended for the shepherds that night or for the people of that day. This is good news of great joy for all people, and all means all. All means you. All means me. This message was intended for all of us, and here's the reason, because this is the flip side of the coin. The Bible makes it clear that the human condition is sinful. We are all sinners. And because we're all sinners, we all need a savior, and thus this is good news for all. Because Jesus came to save us. As many as would call upon his name, as many as who would believe in him by faith. But we have to acknowledge our need for a savior by admitting that we're a sinner. Now, again, the word sin is not a common word that is used in everyday conversation. It's a Bible word, but it's an important word to understand. That we are all sinners. The Bible says in Romans 3 23, all have sinned, all of us, and fallen short of the glory of God, meaning we don't measure up to the perfect standard of God. And guess what? Only perfect people get into heaven. And you say to yourself, Well, I'm not perfect. Nobody's perfect. Exactly. That's why we need a perfect Savior who died for us. That if we trust what he did, then God says to all of us, you can be saved. You can be reconciled. You can come to heaven when you die if you trust what Christ did on the cross. Now, some of you may not be willing to admit that you're a sinner. Let me help you. Okay. Think to yourself, be honest. If you've ever said anything that is bad, if you've ever thought any bad thing, if you've ever done any bad thing, looked at any bad thing. The reason why you know those things are bad because you've become convicted. And the reason you're convicted is because it's God who's given you a conscience saying, those things are sinful against me. All of us are sinners because we've all either said, done, thought, looked at bad things. We are all sinners, the Bible describes, the human condition. But listen, salvation is given to all who would believe and receive by faith. This is a gift. I want everybody to understand this is a gift that God has is offering anyone to receive Jesus Christ. It is a gift. Look, a gift by definition is something we do not earn. It is given to us freely. You, if you work a job where you get a salary, your salary is what you earn. You earn a salary because you are compensated for your hard work and your good performance. Nobody takes your paycheck home and says, hey, honey, look at the gift my boss gave me. It's not a gift. You earned it. You worked for it. You performed well for it, which is very different from salvation. Salvation is something we cannot earn. We cannot do enough good works to get to heaven that way. This is a free gift, and we don't have to perform to get God to love us. The Bible says, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. So you can't work for this, you can't perform for it, because it is a gift that is freely given. God did all the work for us on the cross. He just asked us to believe and receive this free gift. And by the way, God is infinitely superior than Santa Claus, everybody. Because Santa Claus is a very performance-driven guy. You better perform well and be good if you're gonna get any presents from Santa Claus. You know the song, right? You know that catchy song like Santa Claus is coming to town. It's so catchy, isn't it? It's a catch tune. You know why? Because the words are dark. You ever read the words? You better watch out. You better not cry. You better not pout. I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town. He's making a list. He's checking it twice. He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice. Santa Claus is coming to town. He knows when you are sleeping. That's kind of creepy when you think about it. That's creepy claws right there. He knows when you're awake. He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness' sake. Okay, you know the implication of the song is you better be good or no soup for you. No presents for you. Jack squat. If you're not good, you get nothing. Okay? Hey, good news, everybody. Christianity is not about what you do for God. It's what God has done for you by sending his son Jesus Christ to die on a cross for your sins. Romans 6.23 says the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. In 1943, in the middle of World War II, there was a song that came famous at Christmas time that was first sung by Bing Crosby. The song is entitled, I'll Be Home for Christmas. Now, again, it was written in 1943 in the middle of World War II, first as a tribute to soldiers who were serving overseas, separated from their families at Christmas time. And we still hear it on the radio played today, 82 years later. I'll be home for Christmas. You can plan on me. Please have snow and mistletoe and presence on the tree. Christmas Eve will find me where the love light gleams. I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams. See, because a lot of those boys would not come home from war. And that song connected in 1943 as much as it connects today, 82 years later, because that song is about belonging, and everybody wants to be able to do it. To belong. Everybody needs to belong. I'll be home for Christmas. Home is not about four bedrooms and two and a half baths. Home is about who's in it. Where there's connection and warmth and love. That's what makes a home. Everybody wants that. And I don't know what kind of a home you came from. Whether you grew up in a broken home. Whether you grew up in a happy home. I don't know if right now you have a home with a lot of laughter. Or a home with a lot of tears. But I know this much. God wants you to come home to him. There's room in his family. Every single one of us. The invitation is wide open for us to belong to God's family. I don't mean join a church. Okay? You're welcome to be here, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about belonging to God's family because you know that Jesus loves you, came to this earth to save us from our sins, died on that cross. So that whoever trusts in what Jesus did have sins forgiven. To be right with God, to have a clear conscience. To know that you know when you die, you're gonna go to heaven to be with him forever. This is the good news of great joy that is for all people. The question is, do you want that? That's what God wants for you. It's time for you to come home to him. Some of you have been running from God for a long time. And tonight's the night where you're gonna come home to him. You say, Well, how do I do that? Here's how just a moment. I'm gonna pray, and I'm gonna invite you to come when I start to pray to get up out of your seat and to come and to stand down front here. And for as many as are standing here, whether it's one or a hundred people, I'll lead you in a collective word of prayer to invite Jesus Christ to come into your life and to trust him as your Lord and Savior. In the previous services, I said, this invitation is for anybody five to ninety-five. Well, two services ago, I had a lady come up to me and tell me that her dad was in the service, and he accepted Jesus along with many others who came forward. He's 97 years old. So I had to change, I had to change the demographics. This is for anybody five to a hundred. Because nobody should be left out to know that today can be the day of your salvation if you would choose Jesus. Now you might say to me, why can't I just pray that prayer sitting right where I'm seated instead of coming forward in front of all these people? And I understand the question. You could pray the prayer right where you're seated. The fact is that when Jesus died on a cross, he did it very publicly for you and me. And he calls us to come publicly to him. And everybody around you will applaud because we're always excited to see when people walk forward to receive Jesus. But you have to want this. Don't feel forced or coerced or manipulated in any way, but also don't leave here with regrets. I want to make it easy for people who want to walk forward by asking everyone. This is a very somber moment, very serious moment. So please don't try to rush and beat the traffic. I'm gonna ask everybody, please to just quietly stand where you are. Could you everybody please stand so that people can walk out from the roads? This is also for you in the cafe in the chapel in room 7800, start walking now. If you want to join us here in the sanctuary, start walking now as I start to pray. If you want to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior, make a bold decision to come forward here, and I'll lead everybody in prayer who's standing down here. Come now as I pray. Lord, I thank you for those that you will lead here. I thank you, Lord, for men and women and young people that you're calling today to be saved. Would you move right now among those that you are calling? That they would not leave here with regrets, but they would come forward to receive you as Lord and Savior. Thank you for your love.
